Trump blasts Michigan AG for 'viciously threatening' Ford for letting him tour plant without mask,Donald Trump,Brie Stimson,2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.President Trump blasted the attorney general of Michigan late Thursday after she said she was going to have a “very serious conversation” with Ford Motor Co. for allowing the president to go without a mask during part of a tour of the company's Rawsonville Components Plant in Ypsilanti.“The Wacky Do Nothing Attorney General of Michigan, Dana Nessel, is viciously threatening Ford Motor Company for the fact that I inspected a Ventilator plant without a mask,” Trump tweeted after his tour. “Not their fault, & I did put on a mask. No wonder many auto companies left Michigan, until I came along!”Trump did wear a mask for part of the tour of the plant that has been repurposed to make medical supplies, but refused to put it on in front of reporters -- although at least one photographer snapped a photo that was posted on social media. It showed the president wearing a mask that included the presidential seal.""I had one on before,” Trump told reporters during the visit. “I wore one on in this back area. I didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it. In the back area I did have a mask on. I had goggles and a mask right back there.”TRUMP BRINGS MASK TO FORD, SAYS HE DOESN'T 'WANT TO GIVE THE PRESS THE PLEASURE OF SEEING' HIM WEARING ITHe added it wasn’t necessary to wear a mask around reporters and Ford representatives in the front of the plant because “Everybody's been tested.”Nessel told CNN the state would be speaking to Ford about allowing the president to go without a mask for the public portion of the tour in what she said was a violation of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive order requiring masks in enclosed public spaces.""They knew exactly what the order was and if they permitted anyone, even the president of the United States, to defy that order, I think it has serious health consequences potentially to their workers,” Nessel told CNN.She also said she was ""ashamed"" to have him as the president and she hoped Michigan voters ""will remember this when November comes, that he didn't care enough about their safety, he didn't care about their welfare, he didn't respect them enough just to engage in the very simple task, the painless task, the easy task of wearing a mask when he was provided one.""Trump suggested in another tweet that Ford might leave Michigan if it's held accountable for his actions.“Do nothing A.G. of the Great State of Michigan, Dana Nessel, should not be taking her anger and stupidity out on Ford Motor - they might get upset with you and leave the state, like so many other companies have - until I came along and brought business back to Michigan. JOBS!” he wrote.When asked if it was true that it wasn’t required that the president wear a mask, Ford’s CEO, Jim Hackett, told reporters, “It’s up to him.”In a statement Thursday afternoon, the Ford Motor Company added: “Bill Ford encouraged President Trump to wear a mask when he arrived. He wore a mask during a private viewing of three Ford GTs from over the years. The president later removed the mask for the remainder of the visit.” Bill Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford, has been the company’s executive chairman.Nessel later responded to Trump on Twitter, defending the state's auto industry.""Hi! After struggling with our Gov & SOS, impressed you know my name,"" she wrote. ""Seems like you have a problem with all 3 women who run MI-as well as your ability to tell the truth. The auto industry has been thriving for years bc of our incredible auto workers & companies.""CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGEShe added that it was hard to say she's done nothing ""with all the lawsuits myself and the other @DemocraticAGs have filed and won against you.""Fox News' Morgan Phillips contributed to this report."

I had goggles and a mask right back there.”While speaking without a face covering -- next to others wearing masks -- the president added that masks were not necessary in the front of the plant, where he was standing. “They’re not necessary here. Everybody’s been tested, in fact I was tested this morning so it’s not necessary,” the president said. “I was given a choice and I had one on in an area where they preferred it.”He continued, “I honestly - I think I look better in the mask, but I am making a speech, so I won’t have it now.”When asked if it was true that it wasn’t required that the president wear a mask, Ford’s CEO, Jim Hackett, told reporters, “It’s up to him.”In a statement Thursday afternoon, the Ford Motor Company added: “Bill Ford encouraged President Trump to wear a mask when he arrived. He wore a mask during a private viewing of three Ford GTs from over the years. The president later removed the mask for the remainder of the visit.” Bill Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford, has been the company’s executive chairman.Earlier this week, the company announced that Trump and anyone who accompanied him on his visit to the plant, which has been manufacturing ventilators, were recommended to wear a mask.MICHIGAN AG TELLS TRUMP TO WEAR MASK WHILE VISITING FORD PLANT: 'IT'S THE LAW'“Our policy is that everyone wears PPE [personal protective equipment] to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” the company told Fox News. “We shared all of Ford’s safety protocols, including our manufacturing playbook, employee pamphlet and self-assessment survey with the White House ahead of time and in preparation for this trip.”“The White House has its own safety and testing policies in place and will make its own determination,” the company added.Earlier Thursday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, urged the president to wear a face mask on his visit.“While my department will not act to prevent you from touring Ford’s plant, I ask that while you are on tour you respect the great efforts of the men and women at Ford – and across this state – by wearing a facial covering,” Nessel wrote. “It is not just the policy of Ford, by virtue of the governor’s executive orders. It is currently the law of this state.”TRUMP, AFTER CORONAVIRUS TEST, SAYS 'I TESTED POSITIVELY TOWARD NEGATIVE'Earlier this month, Vice President Mike Pence came under fire for not wearing a mask while touring the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.Pence addressed the controversy and told reporters that while he agreed with the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] about wearing masks to contain the spread of coronavirus, he and everyone around him was tested for the virus regularly.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP“When the CDC issued those guidelines, it was their recognition that people that may have it may prevent transmitting by wearing a mask,” the vice president said. “Since I don’t have it, I thought it would be a good opportunity to be here, speak to these guys and look them in the eye.”Pence has been seen wearing a mask since then."
Michigan AG tells Trump to wear mask while visiting Ford plant: It's 'the law',Donald Trump,Marisa Schultz,2020-05-21,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.Michigan's attorney general urged President Trump to wear a face mask when he visits the state Thursday to tour a Ford Motor Co. plant and to adhere to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's coronavirus executive order, telling the commander in chief that he has a ""legal responsibility"" to follow the law.Dana Nessel, a Democrat, penned an open letter to Trump Wednesday asking him to follow the face-covering policy of Ford Motor Co. and of the state of Michigan. Trump has not been pictured wearing a face mask in public and said he's taking hydroxychloroquine, an unproven COVID-19 drug, as a preventative measure to ward off the contagious virus.“While my Department will not act to prevent you from touring Ford’s plant, I ask that while you are on tour you respect the great efforts of the men and women at Ford – and across this state – by wearing a facial covering,"" Nessel wrote. ""It is not just the policy of Ford, by virtue of the Governor’s Executive Orders. It is currently the law of this State.""FROM BUILDING TRUCKS TO VENTILATORS, FORD PLANT’S CRISIS RESPONSE ON DISPLAY DURING TRUMP'S MICHIGAN VISITMeanwhile, Whitmer hit back at Trump for threatening to withhold federal funds to Michigan amid the pandemic and mass flooding in central Michigan after two dams broke this week.""To have this kind of distraction is just ridiculous to be honest... threatening to take money away from a state that is hurting as bad as we are right now is just scary, and I think something that is unacceptable,"" Whitmer told CBS News' This Morning.Trump made the threat on Twitter stating that Michigan is in trouble for sending out absentee ballots to voters, which he deems ripe for voter fraud. Like other states, Michigan sent out absentee applications, not ballots. Trump corrected his tweet — but the threat to withhold federal dollars to Michigan stood. Michigan's secretary of state said Trump is still wrong.But the issue of whether Trump will wear a mask has been front and center before Trump visits the critical swing state.Michigan has been especially hard hit by the coronavirus, with more than 50,000 confirmed cases and 5,000 deaths.Everyone, including Trump, has an obligation to follow the law, the attorney general said.""We must all do our part to stop the spread of COVID-19,"" Nessel wrote. ""Anyone who has potentially been recently exposed, including the President of the United States, has not only a legal responsibility, but also a social and moral responsibility, to take reasonable precautions to prevent further spread of the virus.”FORD SAYS TRUMP SHOULD WEAR MASK WHEN VISITING PLANT ON THURSDAYRep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich, also urged Trump to wear a mask as he visits her district.""The spread is real,"" Dingell said Thursday. ""No one is above these steps, and it is my respectful wish that Trump and his entire team take these protocols seriously. Their actions do have consequences, and wearing the masks might save a life.""On Thursday afternoon, Trump is expected to tour a Ford Motor Co. plant in Ypsilanti Township that had to stop making automobiles during the pandemic but reconfigured in April to make ventilators. Ford said it will deliver 50,000 ventilators by mid-July to help with the coronavirus response.TRUMP HITS THE SWING STATES, EVEN WITH CAMPAIGN BATTLE IN CORONAVIRUS LIMBOThe plant has strict protocols in place for its employees. Workers must take a questionnaire daily and certify that they don't have symptoms before entering the workplace. Upon arrival, employees have a no-touch temperature scan. All employees wear a face mask at work. Safety glasses with side shields or face shields are also required for positions that don't allow for social distancing.While other White House staff have been wearing masks in the wake of West Wing staffers getting infected, Trump has resisted using one in public.Asked Tuesday if he would wear a mask at the Ford plant, Trump said: “I don’t know.”He added: ""It depends on [the] situation. So we'll see. Where it's appropriate, I would do it. Certainly."""
"Trump, after coronavirus test, says 'I tested positively toward negative'",Donald Trump,Morgan Phillips,2020-05-22,"President Trump on Thursday disclosed the results of his daily coronavirus test by saying he “tested positively toward negative.”""I tested very positively in another sense. I tested positively toward negative,” Trump told reporters. “I tested perfectly this morning, meaning I tested negative.”Trump announced on May 7 that he, Vice President Pence and other senior officials would begin receiving daily coronavirus tests after a member of the president's valet tested positive for the virus, which has infected 1.5 million Americans and killed more than 93,000.Around the same time, Pence’s press secretary Katie Miller contracted the disease.TRUMP SAYS G7 LIKELY TO BE HELD AT WHITE HOUSE DESPITE CORONAVIRUS CONCERNSThis week, the president announced he was taking hydroxychloroquine at the direction of his physician to avoid contracting COVID-19.Trump said he has been taking hydroxychloroquine and a zinc supplement daily for almost two weeks -- even though the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has said hydroxychloroquine should only be used in formal studies.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPTrump has spent weeks pushing the drug as a potential cure for COVID-19, despite there being no consensus on its effectiveness or safety. Dr. Sean Conley, the president's physician, announced the decision in a statement Monday night, saying: ""After numerous discussions he and I had about regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks."""
"From building trucks to ventilators, Ford plant’s crisis response on display during Trump's Michigan visit",Proud American,Marisa Schultz,2020-05-21,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.When President Trump arrives in Michigan Thursday, he'll get a chance to see one of the success stories of America's innovative all-hands-on-deck response to the coronavirus pandemic.Trump will tour the Ford Motor Co. Rawsonville plant that reconfigured its operations during the pandemic and shifted from making automobiles to ventilators to help save lives.And much like how Detroit was the Arsenal of Democracy during World War II, with Ford's Willow Run plant producing one B-24 Liberator airplane per hour, the workers on today's pandemic response assembly line feel a similar sense of pride for helping fellow Americans during hard times.""I could not be more proud of my fellow rank and file workers,"" said Terry Bowman, a Ford Motor Co. Rawsonville plant employee who is working on the ventilator project.""They could have stayed home all safe and sound. But yet, all of these workers ... decided on their own, that they wanted to come in and work on a ventilator project in the middle of this pandemic.""Bowman, 54, normally makes transmission oil pumps for trucks at the Ypsilanti Township plant, then the pandemic came and stay-home orders hit. Ford closed the plant and Bowman went on unemployment in March.FORD SAYS TRUMP SHOULD WEAR MASK WHEN VISITING PLANT ON THURSDAYWhen Congress passed the more than $2 trillion CARES Act in March, workers on unemployment got an additional $600 per week payment from the federal government on top of the normal state benefits. In Michigan, the maximum rate is $362 per week. So with the added federal boost, laid-off autoworkers could get $962 a week. That rate would amount to more than $50,000 a year.So when Ford put out the call for workers to voluntarily come back to work to make ventilators and personal protective equipment, some of those who stepped up were making less money by putting their health on the line to work than by staying home and collecting unemployment checks, said Bowman.""A lot of the workers are actually working only 40 hours and making less than what they would have if they would have just stayed home and received the additional $600 unemployment,"" said Bowman, who ended up making more because of overtime.""All these volunteer workers did not have to be there but decided to come in to be a part of something bigger than themselves,"" he added.In all, more than 1,000 Ford employees signed up to work at four southeast Michigan auto plants that have been converted to make ventilators and personal protective equipment. Other plants are making masks, respirators and face shields.General Electric was called up to make ventilators by Trump under the Defense Production Act. Ford Motor Company became GE's supplier and began ventilator production in late April.Ford converted an unused portion of the Rawsonville plant to build out the ventilator manufacturing unit. Ford intends to manufacture 50,000 of the GE/Airon Model A-E ventilators by mid-July.The ventilator model is unique because it runs on compressed air, not electricity, so it doesn't need to be plugged it. It's ideal for a quick setup in an emergency, on the battlefield and during the transport of patients.Ford said it dubbed the ventilator and PPE production “Project Apollo” after the Apollo 13 launch in 1970 when a lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank failed two days into the mission, forcing the astronauts to improvise a fix.TRUMP HITS THE SWING STATES, EVEN WITH CAMPAIGN BATTLE IN CORONAVIRUS LIMBOBowman, who is co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party and active on the Trump campaign, said he wrote the White House to invite Trump to see firsthand the effort of Ford workers helping in the coronavirus crisis.Despite working 37 days straight, Bowman said the mood on the ventilator assembly is very positive as workers have the patriotic spirit of helping serve the country during the global pandemic. Michigan has been especially hard hit by the pandemic. Nationwide, more than 1.5 million people have been sickened by the contagious virus and more than 93,000 Americans have died.""The ventilator project was brought about by the Defense Production Act, which hasn't really been used in 78 years, so I thought it was pretty historic,"" Bowman said on his decision to sign up for the project. ""I wanted to be a part of something historic.""My family has all been healthy, and I thought there's a moral issue to this: Shouldn't you go back and help people who might need ventilators? I just thought it was the right thing to do.""THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNFord is taking additional precautions for workers on the special coronavirus projects and as the auto manufacturing begins to reopen. Before Bowman heads to work, he logs online at home and answers a questionnaire to certify that he doesn't have symptoms. When he arrives, he has a no-touch temperature scan. All employees wear a face mask at work. Safety glasses with side shields or face shields are also required for jobs that don't allow for social distancing.""I feel safer at work than I do anywhere,"" Bowman said.Trump's visit to Michigan marks his latest travel to a swing state in an effort to demonstrate his desire to get American back to work. Trump is expected to tout America as ""the king of ventilators"" and to praise the collaboration between Ford and General Electric.The two U.S. companies ""have stepped up to make ventilators and PPE in a time of need -- exemplifying the power of the American spirit and ingenuity at work,"" the White House said in a statement. ""Ford has a rich history stepping up in a time of crisis. During WWII, their Willow Run assembly plant was producing one B-24 per hour.""CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPThe White House also applauded Ford for its American pride. ""Ford assembles more vehicles in the U.S. than any other manufacturer and more than 75 percent of what the company sells in the U.S. is assembled in the U.S., more than any other automaker."""
Andrew McCarthy: Flynn judge must explain his astounding and offensive refusal to dismiss charges,OPINION,Andrew McCarthy,2020-05-22,"Is U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan’s collusion cameo nearing its end?On Thursday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, on its own motion, ordered Judge Sullivan to respond within 10 days to the petition for a writ of mandamus filed by former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.Earlier this week, Flynn’s counsel, Sidney Powell, filed the petition for that extraordinary writ, asking the appellate court to instruct Sullivan to grant the Justice Department’s motion to dismiss the case against Flynn.FEDERAL APPEALS COURT ORDERS JUDGE IN FLYNN CASE TO RESPOND TO MOTION TO DISMISS CHARGESCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERThat was after Judge Sullivan not only declined to grant the prosecution’s motion, but (a) invited non-parties to intervene in the case by filing amicus briefs (transparently, to make arguments that he somehow has authority to deny DOJ’s motion); and (b) appointed one amicus, former federal judge John Gleeson, as a quasi-prosecutor to make arguments that prosecutors are declining to make in favor of entering a judgment of conviction and sentencing Flynn.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAs I noted Wednesday, Sullivan’s encouragement of amicus briefs, which are not authorized in criminal cases, flies in the face of Sullivan’s own very firm orders previously declining to permit amicus briefs in Flynn’s case – some two dozen times by Powell’s count.The appointment of Gleeson is equally astonishing and offensive to the principle of courts as impartial arbiters.CLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEWCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY"
Federal appeals court orders judge in Flynn case to respond to motion to dismiss charges,Michael Flynn,Adam Shaw,2020-05-22,"A federal appeals court on Thursday directed the judge hearing the case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn to respond to a petition by Flynn for the charges against him to be thrown out.Flynn’s attorney earlier this week had filed an emergency writ of mandamus to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals seeking that the prosecution against Flynn be dismissed as the Justice Department has requested, and for Judge Emmet Sullivan to be taken off the case.FlYNN ATTORNEY FILES EMERGENCY APPEAL TO SHUT DOWN JUDGE SULLIVAN'S ORDERS, BOOT HIM FROM CASEThe order issued Thursday directs Sullivan to file a response by June 1, and invited the government to respond ""in its discretion within the same 10-day period.""Writs of mandamus are extraordinary remedies, which are appropriate when there has been a ""usurpation of judicial power"" that is ""clear and indisputable.”Flynn lawyer Sidney Powell has argued that the judge did exactly that when he refused the DOJ’s request and instead appointed a retired judge to argue against the position held by the DOJ and to consider if Flynn should be held in contempt for perjury.COTTON SUPPORTS SENATE SUBPOENA OF EX-OBAMA OFFICIALS: 'GROSS ABUSES OF POWER'Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition. The case formed one of the key parts of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. The case has again sparked controversy in recent weeks after it emerged that top Obama officials, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, were among those who requested the unmasking of Flynn's name.The DOJ dropped the case after internal memos were released raising serious questions about the nature of the investigation.FLYNN NOT MASKED IN REPORT ON KEY CALLS WITH RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR: SOURCEJustice Department officials said they concluded that Flynn's interview by the FBI was ""untethered to, and unjustified by, the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Flynn"" and that the interview was ""conducted without any legitimate investigative basis.""The DOJ requested Sullivan dismiss the case, but he announced that he would permit outside parties to weigh in and appointed Judge John Gleeson to argue against the DOJ’s position.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn their emergency petition, Flynn's attorneys said Sullivan “has no authority to adopt the role of prosecutor or change the issues in the case.""“This is an umpire who has decided to steal public attention from the players and focus it on himself,"" the lawyers wrote. “He wants to pitch, bat, run bases and play shortstop.

"Hans von Spakovsky: Michael Flynn – appeals court should grant these two requests on case, judge",OPINION,Hans A. von Spakovsky,2020-05-21,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.Attorney Sidney Powell has fired a broadside at Judge Emmet Sullivan.On Tuesday, she filed a writ of mandamus asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to order Sullivan to grant the Justice Department’s motion to dismiss the case against her client, Gen. Michael Flynn.The Court of Appeals should issue that order and override Sullivan’s unprecedented and, frankly, bizarre behavior in opening up the criminal prosecution of Flynn to input from outside parties and appointing John Gleeson, a former federal prosecutor and retired federal judge (who recently penned an op-ed attacking the Justice Department), to argue against the department’s motion.ANDREW McCARTHY: THE SUSAN RICE MICHAEL FLYNN CYA EMAILGleeson has even told Sullivan that he may need to engage in “additional factual development.” In other words, a nonparty, private lawyer is making the astounding proposal that he be given the powers of a government prosecutor.The Justice Department moved to dismiss the charges against Flynn after an internal investigation revealed troubling information about the prosecution. The department concluded that it could not prove its case to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.The department has now determined that the FBI had no evidence justifying an interview of Flynn in the first place. That interview resulted in the claim that Flynn “lied” to the FBI. A valid prosecution would require that the alleged lie be “material” to an investigation. Since there was no legitimate basis for an investigation, the “materiality” requirement could not be met.Rather than try to respond to the procedural nightmare Sullivan has created, Powell is now trying to go over his head.So what is a writ of mandamus? It is a request that a higher court order a lower court to perform its duty properly. The power of mandamus is given to federal appellate courts by The All Writs Act (28 U.S.C. § 1651). As a Justice Department manual on court procedures notes: “Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, which should only be used in exceptional circumstances of peculiar emergency or public importance.”In Cheney v. U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (2004), the Supreme Court established three conditions that Flynn – or any other petitioner – must meet before a writ can be granted:he must demonstrate that he has “no other adequate means to obtain the relief” he requires;his right to the writ must be “clear and indisputable;”the court “in the exercise of its discretion must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.”Powell makes a strong case that this matter meets all of those requirements.Powell also argues that Judge Sullivan’s behavior in the case “reveal[s] a deep-seated antagonism” toward Flynn.Powell argues that by refusing to grant the government’s motion to dismiss, Sullivan has “exceeded” his authority, “egregiously abused” his discretion, and is defying precedents of both the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court. That includes a 2016 decision, U.S. v. Fokker Servs., in which the Court of Appeals said that the power of a district court judge like Sullivan is “narrow” and circumscribed when the government requests the dismissal of a prosecution.That power is limited to ensuring that government prosecutors are not engaging in harassment by repeated prosecutions – dismissing a case only to refile it again later against the same defendant. Here, it appears that it is the judge who is engaging in possible harassment, not the prosecution. The Court of Appeals specifically said in Fokker that a judge can’t deny a motion to dismiss a prosecution just because the judge “has a disagreement with the prosecution’s” decision.Moreover, Powell points out that, by opening up the case to third parties to file amicus briefs and appointing a retired judge to argue against the government, Sullivan is acting in direct defiance of another Supreme Court decision issued less than two weeks ago.In U.S. v. Sineneng-Smith, a unanimous court chastised (and vacated a ruling by) the Ninth Circuit for engaging in similar behavior, opening up a criminal case to third parties to file amicus briefs and instructing them to address an issue that had not been raised by either the government or the defendant in the case.Powell also argues that Sullivan’s behavior in the case “reveal[s] a deep-seated antagonism” toward Flynn. At Flynn’s initial sentencing hearing, she notes, Sullivan “publicly berated” Flynn, although the government had reassured the judge that Flynn had given them “substantial cooperation.” The judge, she writes, “suggested [Flynn] may have committed ‘treason,’ asserted that he had ‘sold [his] country out,’ and expressed ‘disdain’ and ‘disgust’ for General Flynn’s conduct – flat wrong on crucial facts of the case.”CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERPowell argues that these criticisms “even uttered in private conversation,” would be grounds for Sullivan to recuse himself from the case. Saying “them to the world” makes “fair judgment impossible.”This is the United States, not France or one of the handful of other countries where the roles of prosecutors and judges are combined. As Powell correctly argues, our Constitution places the law enforcement and prosecutorial functions in the executive branch, not the judicial branch. Sullivan has “disregarded the constitutional imperative of a ‘case and controversy’ and the ‘separation of powers’ that invest the power to prosecute solely in the executive branch.” He has “no authority to adopt the role of prosecutor or change the issues in the case by inviting or appointing amici to perform the investigation or prosecution that the court deems appropriate.”Powell summarizes Sullivan’s errant behavior by using Chief Justice John Roberts’ well-known baseball analogy: ""This is an umpire who has decided to steal public attention from the players and focus it on himself. He wants to pitch, bat, run bases and play shortstop. In truth, he is way out in left field.”CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPowell not only asks the Court of Appeals to order Sullivan to dismiss the prosecution, but she also asks the court to assign another judge to the case for any final proceedings that may occur: “one who has not implied that [Flynn] is a traitor.”The interests of fundamental fairness and the objective, nonpartisan administration of justice favor the Court of Appeals granting both of those requests.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY HANS VON SPAKOVSKY"

"Over 4,300 virus patients sent to NY nursing homes, AP counts",New York,"Bernard Condon, _Jennifer Peltz, _Jim Mustian | Associated Press",2020-05-21,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.More than 4,300 recovering coronavirus patients were sent to New York’s already vulnerable nursing homes under a controversial state directive that was ultimately scrapped amid criticisms it was accelerating the nation’s deadliest outbreaks, according to a count by The Associated Press.AP compiled its own tally to find out how many COVID-19 patients were discharged from hospitals to nursing homes under the March 25 directive after New York’s Health Department declined to release its internal survey conducted two weeks ago. It says it is still verifying data that was incomplete.Whatever the full number, nursing home administrators, residents’ advocates and relatives say it has added up to a big and indefensible problem for facilities that even Gov. Andrew Cuomo — the main proponent of the policy — called “the optimum feeding ground for this virus.”Cuomo downplays calls for federal probe into nursing home coronavirus deaths: 'Ask President Trump'“It was the single dumbest decision anyone could make if they wanted to kill people,” Daniel Arbeeny said of the directive, which prompted him to pull his 88-year-old father out of a Brooklyn nursing home where more than 50 people have died. His father later died of COVID-19 at home.“This isn’t rocket science,” Arbeeny said. “We knew the most vulnerable -- the elderly and compromised -- are in nursing homes and rehab centers.”Told of the AP’s tally, the Health Department said late Thursday it “can’t comment on data we haven’t had a chance to review, particularly while we’re still validating our own comprehensive survey of nursing homes admission and re-admission data in the middle of responding to this global pandemic.”Cuomo, a Democrat, on May 10 reversed the directive, which had been intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged. But he continued to defend it this week, saying he didn’t believe it contributed to the more than 5,800 nursing and adult care facility deaths in New York — more than in any other state — and that homes should have spoken up if it was a problem.“Any nursing home could just say, ‘I can’t handle a COVID person in my facility,’” he said, although the March 25 order didn’t specify how homes could refuse, saying that ”no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the (nursing home) solely based” on confirmed or suspected COVID-19.Over a month later, on April 29, the Health Department clarified that homes should not take any new residents if they were unable to meet their needs, including a checklist of standards for coronavirus care and prevention.In the meantime, some nursing homes felt obligated and overwhelmed.Gurwin Jewish, a 460-bed home on Long Island, seemed well-prepared for the coronavirus in early March, with movable walls to seal off hallways for the infected. But after the state order, a trickle of recovering COVID-19 patients from local hospitals turned into a flood of 58 people.More walls were put up, but other residents nonetheless began falling sick and dying. In the end, 47 Gurwin residents died of confirmed or suspected COVID-19.The state order “put staff and residents at great risk,” CEO Stuart Almer said. “We can’t draw a straight line from bringing in someone positive to someone catching the disease, but we’re talking about elderly, fragile and vulnerable residents.”The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, known as AMDA, had warned from the beginning that Cuomo’s order admitting infected patients posed a “clear and present danger” to nursing home residents. Now, Jeffrey N. Nichols, who serves on the executive committee of the group, said “the effect of that order was to contribute to 5,000 deaths.”Nationally, over 35,500 people have died from coronavirus outbreaks at nursing homes and long-term care facilities, about a third of the overall death toll, according to the AP’s running tally.Cuomo has deflected criticism over the nursing home directive by saying it stemmed from Trump administration guidance. Still, few states went as far as New York and neighboring New Jersey, which has the second-most care home deaths, in discharging hospitalized coronavirus patients to nursing homes. California followed suit but loosened its requirement following intense criticism.Some states went in the opposite direction. Louisiana barred hospitals for 30 days from sending coronavirus patients to nursing homes with some exceptions. And while Louisiana reported about 1,000 coronavirus-related nursing home deaths, far fewer than New York, that was 40% of Louisiana’s statewide death toll, a higher proportion than in New York.New York’s Health Department told the AP May 8 it was not tracking how many recovering COVID-19 patients were taken into nursing homes under the order. But it was at that very moment surveying administrators of the state’s over 1,150 nursing homes and long-term care facilities on just that question.Those survey results have yet to be released. But regardless, the Health Department said, the survey had no bearing on Cuomo’s announcement May 10 that “we’re just not going to send a person who is positive to a nursing home after a hospital visit.”Cuomo said such patients would be accommodated elsewhere, such as sites originally set up as temporary hospitals.To some, the governor’s reversal came too late.CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE“It infected a great number of people in nursing homes who had no business getting infected, including short-term residents who were there for rehabilitation after surgeries,” said John Dalli, a New York attorney who specializes in nursing home cases.To be sure, incoming residents weren’t the only possible source of infection. Some homes believe a bigger contribution came from staffers and residents unaware they had the virus. And some say they would have taken on COVID-19 patients regardless of the state’s order.“There were nursing homes that realized that there was a void,” said Sarah Colomello, a spokeswoman for Thompson House in Rhinebeck. The 100-bed facility set up an isolated unit where affiliated hospitals nearby have sent at least 21 patients. It has reported no deaths.Cuomo administration officials say the original directive came when the governor feared the hospital system would be overwhelmed and was focused on creating as much hospital space as possible.That was welcomed by one of the many hospital systems and nursing homes surveyed for AP’s count. Northwell Health said three of its medical centers were so overtaxed at one point they had to put some ICU patients in hallways. To relieve pressure, the company eventually sent more than 1,700 COVID-19 patients to nursing homes.“Suffice it say, our hospitals were under stress,” spokesman Terence Lynam said."
Lorena Bobbitt on revisiting her notorious case in Lifetime film: 'There was a lot of trauma',Exclusive,Stephanie Nolasco,2020-05-22,"Lorena Bobbitt became a household name nearly 30 years ago when she finally snapped.On the night of June 23, 1993, after suffering years of abuse, the then-24-year-old cut off the penis of her sleeping husband John Wayne Bobbitt, 26, in small-town Manassas, Va.The shocking case, which quickly became the subject of late-night comedy skits, is now the subject of a Lifetime film titled “I Was Lorena Bobbitt,” which follows the now-49-year-old’s account leading up to that fateful day. Bobbitt served as executive producer and on-screen narrator.Lifetime will also run a PSA for the National Domestic Violence Hotline and the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence featuring Bobbitt, as well as Dani Montalvo and Like Humphrey, who star as the controversial couple. The move is part of the network’s public affairs campaign Stop Violence Against Women.DETECTIVE RECALLS MEETING ‘TRUCK STOP KILLER’ BRUCE MENDENHALL IN ‘DEADLY RECALL’: ‘THERE’S EVIL OUT THERE’'FAMILIES OF THE MAFIA' STAR KAREN GRAVANO EXPLAINS WHY DAD SAMMY ‘THE BULL’ IS APPEARING ON MTV REALITY SHOW“I think it’s really important that we are releasing this film now,” Montalvo, 26, who plays Bobbitt, told Fox News. “Now more than ever. I think people are listening. People are starting to realize, 'Hey, women -- they might be onto something. They might be telling the truth. They might all have this one, awful, horrible thing in common. And there’s something that we can do about it.'”“I hope that it... inspires people to reach out,” she continued. “And if they see the signs, they see the patterns of any sort of domestic or sexual violence that they can act. And I think by watching the movie, that they will see what it looks like to live with that sort of reality.”On that night, Bobbitt, a young immigrant who had nowhere to go, fled the scene, organ in hand. She drove off from their home and flung the penis out of the driver’s side window into a field.Police later went digging through the overgrown roadside grass for the missing member, The New York Times reported. They found it, put it on ice in a Big Bite hot dog box from a nearby 7-Eleven and then rushed it to the hospital for the bleeding spouse. The former Marine then underwent surgery for nearly 10 hours and had it reattached.KIM KARDASHIAN DETAILS HER NEW DOC, SAYS SHE'S NOT WORRIED ABOUT JUSTICE REFORM CRITICS‘FORGOTTEN WEST MEMPHIS THREE’ DOC AIMS TO GIVE VICTIMS OF NOTORIOUS CRIME 'THEIR VOICES BACK,’ HOST SAYSAt the time, a distraught Bobbitt claimed she was raped by her drunk husband and simply couldn’t take years of physical, sexual and emotional abuse anymore. But the notorious cause would go on to be sensationalized by tabloids and Bobbitt was depicted as a pop-culture punchline.At the time, martial rape only recently had been made a crime in all 50 states and was nearly impossible to prove in Virginia, The New York Times reported.“For some reason, the media was just infatuated about the cutting of this penis instead of what actually is the essence and the core of the story,” Bobbitt told Fox News. “The story was about domestic violence, domestic abuse, sexual assault… the media just missed this window of opportunity to tell [that].”“We have to understand that the media has a big platform to influence people’s opinion,” she said. “So whenever I see tabloids and it’s all about... penis this and penis that, it was like, ‘Wow, they’re really missing [the point].’ And in the movie… you’ll see I was very traumatized because his trial went first. And I really believed that I was going to prison. I was going to jail. The whole thing was based on something else. There [wasn’t] a focus on the real story.”PRINCE ANDREW ACCUSER VIRGINIA ROBERTS GIUFFRE TO STAR IN NETFLIX DOC ABOUT JEFFREY EPSTEINHARVEY WEINSTEIN ACCUSER CAITLIN DULANY RESPONDS TO SENTENCING: ‘I CAN NOW CELEBRATE A TRULY HISTORIC VICTORY’Bobbitt admitted it was difficult to see her turbulent past play out on set during filming.“It was very [traumatizing],” she said. “When I arrived on the scene, actually I was not able to see the sexual-assault scene because I arrived two days later. They just finished filming it. But there were a lot of emotions. There was a lot of trauma. And I knew I was going to get into it. I was prepared mentally because first of all, I helped with the script and I’m an executive producer. I knew exactly what was going on. And that helped me to actually prepare myself to know what I was going to expect. That was my story. I know my story the best.”The couple was initially charged in separate trials, Rolling Stone reported. For her, it was malicious wounding and for him, it was martial sexual assault. However, both were acquitted. Bobbitt, whose trial was televised by Court TV, successfully pleaded not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. They officially divorced in 1995.The Lifetime film isn’t the first time Bobbitt has come forward to shed new light on her story. Back in 2019, Amazon Studios released “Lorena,” a four-part docuseries that was executive produced by Jordan Peele.GREEN RIVER KILLER GARY RIDGWAY IS STILL HIDING MANY 'DARK SECRETS' DESPITE CONFESSION, SAYS PROSECUTOR IN DOCUMENTARYMISSING IOWA TV JOURNALIST JODI HUISENTRUIT'S FAMILY STILL SEARCHING YEARS LATER, DOC REVEALS: ‘IT'S HORRIBLE'While Bobbitt had avoided turning the high-profile take into a film or TV series of the year, she agreed to participate in the Amazon project in hopes of setting the record straight. Her ex-husband also agreed to participate, although the 53-year-old later claimed he was allegedly set up to be depicted as “a violent mean guy.”In a statement to Fox News, filmmaker Joshua Rofé said: “Lorena, John Wayne and more than 40 other witnesses, attorneys, jurors and experts were interviewed over the course of a year to give this docuseries a complete picture of events that took place. This is something Lorena Gallo was not afforded 25 years ago when the story was misconstrued and unfairly sensationalized in the public eye.”In the years since the trial, John Wayne was arrested several times and served jail for violence against two different women, according to The New York Times. He also denied those allegations.Over the years, Bobbitt has focused on launching the Lorena Gallo Foundation, which is dedicated to raising awareness on domestic violence and offering support to loved ones.EX-JEHOVAH’S WITNESS RECOUNTS SEXUAL ABUSE IN DOC, ORGANIZATION DENIES TRYING TO COVER IT UPLAS VEGAS SHOOTING SURVIVORS RECALL ‘CHAOS AND TURMOIL’ OF HORRIFIC NIGHT, MEETING RESCUER, IN NEW DOCUMENTARYBobbitt hopes that the film -- and her story -- will compel other women to speak out and not suffer in silence.“I’m glad I have a platform now,” she said. “I have a voice to talk and communicate what really happened and to be transparent, be raw. These are real issues. These are real victims. They’re suffering right now. And not only here in the United States, but around the world. [It] is affecting many, many people… And I want them to understand that there’s hope… Maybe they can escape domestic violence by saying, ‘Hey, you know what? This is what happened to me. And I’m not going to be such in this abusive situation. I have resources. I can get away. I can get out in the end.’”“If my story helps at least one person to escape domestic violence, then my mission is complete,” she added. “My suffering was not in vain.”“I Was Lorena Bobbit” premieres Monday, May 25, at 8 p.m. ET on Lifetime.If you or someone you know is suffering from abuse, please contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673."

Dems make big push to aid illegal immigrants amid coronavirus crisis,Illegal Immigrants,Adam Shaw,2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.Congressional Democrats and state governments are pushing a range of ways to assist illegal immigrants in their response to the coronavirus crisis, calling for the release of those in detention and lobbying to make them eligible for over a thousand dollars each in stimulus payments.President Trump, for his part, has responded to the crisis by cracking down on both illegal and legal immigration — slapping travel bans on China, Iran and the European Union and limiting entry on land borders to the north and south, while border officials are immediately returning illegal immigrants and asylum seekers to their home countries.HOUSE DEMOCRATS' CORONAVIRUS PACKAGE INCLUDES 'AMNESTY' FOR SOME ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, CRITICS SAYDemocrats, however, are taking the opposite approach. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., have introduced a bill that would release immigrants in detention into the country, and halt any immigration enforcement against anyone not deemed a “significant” threat to public safety.“We have an obligation to do everything we can to prevent the spread of this deadly disease, and that means moving people out of detention centers when they do not pose a public safety risk,” Booker said in a statement. “This is really a matter of life and death: it’s time that we act quickly and decisively to save as many lives as possible, and that means ending the unnecessary detention of immigrants during this public health crisis.”Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Democrats are demanding that the next round of stimulus checks include illegal immigrants by modifying a requirement that recipients have a Social Security number to receive one.DRUG CARTELS AT THE BORDER TRYING TO 'EXPLOIT' CORONAVIRUS CRISIS, CBP CHIEF SAYSA $3 trillion bill passed by the Democratic-controlled House last week would allow the $1,200 stimulus checks to go to those who also pay income taxes via an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) — which is used by people who are ineligible for a Social Security number, including illegal immigrants.As partial justification, Democrats have pointed to so-called mixed families, in which there are American citizens or legal permanent residents, as well as illegal immigrants, in one family. They file using an ITIN and so far have not been eligible for aid.“The Supreme Court ruled that children, undocumented children should have a right to education in our country. Why not then should citizens’ children, children in taxpayers’ families, not have the opportunity to the checks that they need?” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on a press call this month.But it’s an idea that has drawn strong criticism, even mockery, from Republicans who believe that aid should be reserved only to citizens and those here legally.“Can you believe it? We forgot to have the Treasury Department send money to people here illegally. My goodness. What an oversight,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor last week.The bill also included protections for “essential critical infrastructure workers” that would allow some illegal immigrants employed as such to be placed into “a period of deferred action” and be authorized to work if they meet certain conditions.It also grants protections to those employers who hire illegal immigrants, stating that “the hiring, employment or continued employment” of the defined group of illegal immigrants is not in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act.The move was flagged by Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli as a push by Democrats to grant ""amnesty"" to illegal immigrants and protection to those who employ them.“Is it really a good idea to not only grant an amnesty to illegal aliens but to absolve employers who have been breaking the law in the last few months?” he tweeted. “I don't think so!”SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL CALLS FOR $100 MILLION 'RELIEF FUND' FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTSMeanwhile, some state governments have been seeking to make sure illegal immigrants receive money and argue they should have been included in the last round of stimulus.The Seattle City Council is calling on Washington state to create a $100 million “relief fund” for illegal immigrants who did not qualify for the federal stimulus checks issued last month.The city’s council passed a resolution Monday asking Gov. Jay Inslee to create a “Washington Worker Relief Fund” to provide “economic assistance to undocumented Washingtonians during the COVID-19 pandemic.”Meanwhile in California, the state has opened up about $75 million for a fund to help roughly 150,000 illegal immigrants in the state. It gives them access to a coronavirus relief program that will pay $500 per person and up to $1,000 per household.The developments come as Democrats continue to shift left on immigration issues to the backdrop of the presidential race, drawing contrasts with Republicans who, along with the Trump administration, have advocated even tougher policies.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPDemocrats have opposed a host of Trump’s border security measures, including the wall at the southern border and the “Remain-in-Mexico” policy, while a number of top Democrats and presidential contenders have backed calls to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and to give health care and other social services to illegal immigrants.Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, meanwhile, has been on record calling for health care for illegal immigrants, as well as a 100-day moratorium on deportations if he wins the election in November."

Gavin Newsom’s executive order for an all mail-in ballot election.Judicial Watch filed the suit in a Sacramento district court Thursday on behalf of Issa to block Newsom’s order, which would send absentee ballots to all registered voters, Politico reported. Issa is running for former Rep. Duncan Hunter’s seat in the wake of his resignation.California is the first state this year to move to an all vote-by-mail election because of the coronavirus. While Democrats lauded the executive order, Republicans have raised concerns over voter fraud.The Republican National Committee said it was weighing its options over Newsom’s order, according to Politico.Issa's complaint calls Newsom's order ""unconstitutional,"" and says it could cause the ""votes of countless voters to be thrown out or not counted."" It also says Issa's campaign costs would increase and it would force him to “reevaluate his electoral strategy,” Politico and Court House News reported.Issa “registered to run for office based under the electoral system established by the California Legislature,” the complaint says. “Now, he must develop a new strategy.”President Trump has claimed without evidence that voting by mail leads to voter fraud even though he voted via absentee ballot in Florida this year. “You get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody’s living room, signing ballots all over the place,” he said last month, according to The New York Times.Several other states, including Washington, Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon and Utah already vote by mail.NEWSOM ORDER SENDING MAIL-IN BALLOTS TO ALL CALIFORNIA VOTERS SPARKS CONCERNSNevada and Michigan are among several states planning to increase mail-in voting for the November election.

Rep. Brian Mast: Memorial Day and my fallen friends show us how to thrive after coronavirus,OPINION,Rep. Brian Mast | Fox News,2020-05-21,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.The coronavirus pandemic has confronted our nation with many unique challenges. For the first time in our storied history, Americans were asked to not go to work, to not hustle and to not exhaust ourselves.Now, we are presented with an equal number of questions about how to move forward and re-open. How does America recover? How do we press forward? And how do we move on from the collapse of the routine that has always driven us on?I believe that Memorial Day can help provide the answer to these questions.MICHAEL LEVIN: AFTER CORONAVIRUS, HOW WILL YOU ANSWER THIS IMPORTANT QUESTION?Memorial Day gives us answers because we can reflect and seek spiritual guidance from the most selfless our country has ever known. We look to their grit. We ask ourselves what they would tell us to do and how would they ask us to revere the freedom they gave their last breath to provide.While they are no longer here to share what they learned in person, their stories leave us with lessons that are especially important in times where our country is challenged with adversity.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTEREach week when I fly into Washington, D.C., I see the beautiful white crosses and Stars of David of Arlington National Cemetery from above. When my young boys, Magnum and Maverick, are with me we tour the seemingly endless Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the larger-than-life steel statues of the Korean War Memorial, or the expansive World War II Memorial. In my opinion, there are none from whom we can learn more than these heroes who gave it all so that we may live free.Gracing the walls of the building that houses my office are the names of each fallen brother and sister from my war. Each day, as I pass through the entrance, I see the faces of those I knew, and each time my eye catches a heading for all lost in a given month and year my mind replays conversations had with so many fallen friends.The etching of their names reminds us of their commitment to the fight and the way nothing would ever stop them.Every time, I wonder if we are worthy of their sacrifice. Just as each soldier strives to prove themselves each day of service, I believe my fallen friends would want each civilian to strive to prove themselves each day of free life. In that, I believe, lies the answer to how our country recovers from this crisis.So, this Memorial Day, I am reflecting on the sacrifice of my friends — that I served with, took fire with, climbed mountains in Afghanistan with, disarmed bombs with and took it to America’s enemies with — and the lessons we can learn from them:Americans are never victims. If we wake up under the flag they charged into battle with then we wake up getting to decide that today will be a better day than yesterday and that this week will be better than last week.I believe Staff Sgt. Eric Trueblood (KIA 03/10/2011) would remind us that we are not measured by what we do when something is a walk in the park. Rather, we get measured when we face something that seems impossible.I believe Staff Sgt. David Day (KIA 04/24/2011) would tell us that the tougher the times, the tougher the people get built.Sgt. Justin Allen (KIA 07/18/2010) was never one to feel sorry for himself, so I believe he would take on the challenge with everything he’s got — not once complaining.Sgt. Anibal Santiago (KIA 07/18/2010) would probably challenge everybody — in language that isn’t fit to print — to have the courage to get out and live their lives.I believe Senior Chief Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician Craig Vickers (KIA 08/06/2011) would remind us—in excruciating detail—that, no matter what we do, every minute still has 60 seconds, each hour still has 60 minutes and each day is still going to take 24 of those. We shouldn’t let time pass us by trying to evade life’s challenges.I believe Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician Second Class Petty Officer Tyler Trahan (KIA 04/01/2009) would keep it simple: keep going no matter what, he might say.I believe Capt. Kyle Comfort (KIA 05/08/2010) would remind us that even knowing every possible detail about the coronavirus that there is to know, there is still going to be risk.I believe Doc Jonathan Peney (KIA 06/01/2010) would tell us that not even training to be safe is safe.I believe Sgt. Tanner Higgins (KIA 04/14/2012) would tell us not to waste a moment of this precious life that we have the privilege to live.I believe Sgt. Andrew Nicol (KIA 08/08/2010) would probably say that he didn’t live in tents, cargo ship containers, mud huts and swamps so the people he fought for can curl up and hide.Finally, I believe Sgt. 1st Class Lance Vogeler (KIA 10/01/2010) — one of my closest friends and who I would undoubtedly turn to for advice if he were still here — would share with me a couple lessons. Seek the positive in the negative, he would say. Commitment to life is not about the quantity of minutes we get but about the way we spend the minutes we have and how we effect those in our path.A massive quantity of his minutes were spent in combat fighting for us. He was killed during his 12th deployment, just days after I was taken off the battlefield by an improvised explosive device.Each Memorial Day I am given a renewed commitment to honor his sacrifice and the sacrifice of all those who were laid to rest beneath our beautiful flag of 50 stars and 13 red and white stripes. This Memorial Day, they all remind me that we are not made of glass and we don’t just break when we fall.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPI hope our nation can learn from them. We have been challenged by COVID-19, but Americans are never victims. If we wake up under the flag they charged into battle with then we wake up getting to decide that today will be a better day than yesterday and that this week will be better than last week. If we do not actively work to make it that way then we squander the life and freedom they gave everything to defend.So, for those honored by the slow hum of Taps, I pray that this Memorial Day the crack of their 21-gun salute can be so jarring that it wakes up the world.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP.

34 victims in California dive boat tragedy died of carbon monoxide poisoning: coroner,California,David Aaro,2020-05-22,"The 34 victims in a scuba boat fire off the coast of California last year died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning, according to authorities on Thursday.The Santa Barbara County coroner's reports listed smoke inhalation as the cause of death for all 33 scuba divers and one crew member who died in the fire that broke out aboard the Conception on Sept. 2, 2019. Their deaths were considered accidental, police said.CALIFORNIA DIVE BOAT OWNERS FILE LAWSUIT TO AVOID LIABILITY AFTER DEADLY FIREThe blaze occurred just after 3 a.m., and swept through the boat anchored off Santa Cruz Island for a three-day excursion over Labor Day Weekend. The only survivors were those asleep above deck, which included the captain and four other crew members.Descriptions of the bodies in the report noted some were wearing clothes and shoes, while two were found to have held a cellphone and flashlight, according to Lt. Erik Raney of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office.All of the victims were found out of their bunks, hinting they could have been attempted to escape, although he added there was no way to determine if they were trying to do so. Some were found on the surface of the water, while others inside the boat's hull, or on the ocean floor after it capsized.A number of the victim's families have since filed wrongful-death claims against the Santa Barbara-based operator of the vessel, Truth Aquatics, which is owned by Glen and Dana Fritzler, according to the Santa Barbara Independent.CALIFORNIA DIVE BOAT IN LABOR DAY FIRE WAS EXEMPT FROM COAST GUARD SAFETY REGULATIONS: REPORTIn 1996, the Coast Guard implemented a set of standards on new vessels, requiring escape hatches at least 32 inches wide and illuminated exit signs. The 75-foot vessel, built-in 1981, had a 24-inch hatch and no illuminated signsAn official from the National Transportation Safety Board remarked how difficult it was to reach an escape hatch in the bunk room, which was a design that routinely met regulations. The boat reportedly passed its two most recent safety inspections, according to Coast Guard records.The survivors said they woke to find the boat in flames. They were unable to reach the sleeping passengers and had to jump in the water to save their own lives.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPRaney told The Associated Press the coroner’s office did not do internal autopsies of the bodies.

'Terror-related' shooting at NAS Corpus Christi prompts search for possible 2nd suspect,Manhunt,Dom Calicchio,2020-05-22,"A manhunt was underway in Texas for a possible second suspect after a Thursday shooting at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas that was “terror-related.”“We may have a potential second related person of interest at large in the community,” Leah Greeves, an FBI supervisory senior resident, told reporters, according to KRIS-TV of Corpus Christi.In a series of Twitter messages late Thursday, the FBI’s Houston office called on the public to share any information they may have about the NAS Corpus Christi incident.NAVAL AIR STATION CORPUS CHRISTI SHOOTING INVESTIGATED AS 'TERRORISM-RELATED,' FBI REPORTS“We are not ruling out any possible motives and continue to investigate all leads,” the FBI said in a post. “When we are able to release additional information, we will do so.”A gunman described as an “Arab male” and later identified by The Associated Press as Adam Alsahli of Corpus Christi was killed in a gunbattle with law enforcement at the station, located along the Gulf of Mexico, about 229 miles southwest of Houston.Authorities say the suspect tried to speed his vehicle through a security gate at the naval facility around 6:15 a.m. Thursday but was stopped by a guard who managed to put up a barrier in time to block the driver’s access.A female security officer was shot in the chest during an exchange of gunfire with the suspect, but she was wearing body armor and survived with only minor injuries, KRIS reported.Other security personnel soon arrived and fatally shot the suspect, the AP reported.Following that gunbattle, local police SWAT officers and FBI agents surrounded a home in Corpus Christi. A public records search by KRIS revealed the location to be Alsahli’s last known home address.But authorities would not confirm whether the operation was related to the incident at NAS Corpus Christi, the Caller Times of Corpus Christi reported.After the shooting, the naval air station was on lockdown for about five hours as authorities conducted their investigation.At a news conference, Greeves declared the incident “terror-related,” but provided no details on how investigators reached that conclusion.“We are working diligently with our state, local and federal partners on this investigation, which is fluid and evolving,” Greeves said.Attorney General William Barr has been briefed on the matter, a Justice Department spokesman told the AP.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPA similar lockdown occurred at NAS Corpus Christi last December after a suspect with a stolen firearm rammed a truck into a barricade there. The suspect later pleaded guilty to destruction of U.S. government property.Thursday’s incident also follows a Dec. 6 shooting at NAS Pensacola in Florida that left three U.S. sailors dead and eight other people wounded. The suspect in that case, who had been in contact with al-Qaeda operatives, was killed by a sheriff’s deputy.The Associated Press contributed to this story."

The PennLive report said 37 of the state’s 67 counties are in the yellow stage, which essentially means caution and mitigation. Eighteen counties are red, which means a stay-at-home order is in place.President Trump recently talked about the state’s lockdown and said Pennsylvanians “want their freedom now.”The paper reported that Wolf’s response to the coronavirus has been praised and “Democrats aren’t exactly defecting” but there is some pressure.

Iran picks cyber fight with Israel as both sides target critical infrastructure,TECH,Hollie McKay,2020-05-22,"The simmering cyber conflict between Iran and Israel reached a boiling point this week as the two enemies have been going tit-for-tat in an effort to quietly take down critical infrastructure that security analysts dub something of an electronic cold war.“The fact that Iran is behaving so aggressively, and trying to disrupt critical services in Israel, is very disturbing,” David Kennedy, founder/CEO of TrustedSec, and a former hacker for the NSA and U.S. Marine Corps told Fox News. “Any time you have a state actor engaged in industrial sabotage, that is a real cause for concern. When you attack a critical service like water, power, hospitals, or transportation, you are essentially putting lives at risk.”Last month, Iran fired the first shot by purporting to cyberattack water installations – including tanks, pumps, and pipelines in Israel – raising the alarm among national security and cyber experts over the vulnerability of critical infrastructure.While some slight damage to water valves and control systems did take place, according to Haaretz, ultimately there was no persistent damage to the water supply as the hackers had likely intended.IRAN FACES FURTHER ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION IN CORONAVIRUS FALLOUTAnd then on May 9, the Bandar Abbas port terminal in the south of Iran was suddenly crippled, and shipping traffic was suspended for days. Israel was behind the retaliatory strike back which successfully inflicted severe damage without causing casualties, the Washington Post reported this week.Israeli Water Authority officials reportedly detected the attempt and immediately changed system passwords and took measures to secure their systems.“It is definitely unusual to see a state actor targeting the critical infrastructure assets of another state. That type of activity is usually reserved for war or near-war situations, at least by most countries,” Kennedy surmised. “Iran doesn’t respect those rules.”Moreover, analysts have also pointed out that Iran’s cyberattack was executed through servers based in the United States and Europe, which indicates some degree of sophistication, despite being a routine TACTIC used globally by those adverse to the West.“The Israeli response was measured yet enough to cause logistical and economic disorder from Iran’s main port at a time when they can ill afford any further financial disruptions due to sanctions, low oil prices, unemployment, and massive inflation,” noted Jeff Bardin, the Chief Intelligence Officer at security firm Treadstone 71. “My assumption here is that the Iranians used extracts and updates to Stuxnet code to manipulate the Israeli equipment.”The Stuxnet virus was a joint cyber operation between Israeli and American intelligence and was deployed in 2011 to infect Iran’s then-burgeoning nuclear program – effectively harming the electricity boxes linked to the centrifuges being utilized for uranium enrichment. Nonetheless, Tehran was able to course correct in the aftermath of the course contagion, learning how to bolster its own cyber defense and develop tactics of its own.And following the April attempt to harm Israel’s water systems, the regime is said to have overinflated the outcome in its press as a means of distraction against the coronavirus pandemic crippling much of the nation’s health care system. The gloating prompted Israel to acknowledge that an incident had happened, although it was largely dismissed.“We are in a state of constant cyber cold war accentuated by regular skirmishes such as the Iranian attack on Israeli water systems and the Israeli response on Iran’s main port. Israel does not usually come out of the shadows to execute publicly identified cyber-attacks,” Bardin continued. “They did so this time since Iran was chest-thumping over the attack on the Israeli water system, considered critical infrastructure. Israel had to strike back and did so in such a way that shut down the port for 10 days.”And Kennedy further underscored that because Iran does not have the military might to confront Israel or the United States directly, it is instead forced to engage in asymmetric warfare, of which cyber is an important part.“Ever since Iran was hit by Stuxnet, they have been actively developing their own cyber-kinetic capabilities. This capability is extremely important for Iran because it gives them the ability to strike inside the borders of countries that they could not attack directly with traditional military forces. It also allows them to score PR victories at home, without risking a humiliating military response,” he said. “Iran’s cyber operations against Israel are definitely becoming more aggressive during the pandemic. Anytime you target critical infrastructure, you are seriously escalating the situation.”HOW ISIS IS EXPLOITING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMICAnd things kicked up an extra notch on Thursday, after allegedly Iran-based hackers seemingly infiltrated tens of thousands of unsecured Israeli websites, disabling their functions and blasting threatening videos and messages pertaining to the “crimes against the Palestinians,” and “all we can do is revenge from a cyberattack.”The group remains on both Facebook and Youtube.“Thousands of Israeli sites, including sites of major and major companies in the economy, were vandalized following an attack by anti-Israel officials against the Upress hosting company,” Bardin explained. “The attack disrupted the company’s servers. Instead of the usual content of the sites appears content calling for the destruction of Israel. In addition, the sites ask the users permission to use the camera to take photos.”He pointed out that, at this stage, it is unclear whether the company’s databases were hacked or is it merely a corruption. Upress, one of Israel’s largest website hosting companies, announced on its Facebook page that the attack was caused by security vulnerabilities in the WordPress plugin. “We work in collaboration with the state cyber authority, conduct security investigations, and handle all sites,” the company added.

According to Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow and Iran expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), the use of cyber tools for purposes of damage and espionage is consistent with Iran’s asymmetric military strategy.“Just like proxy wars, the cyber domain permits Iran to mask its hand and involvement, as well as limit the potential for kinetic blowback and escalation,” he explained. “In this regard, Iran’s cyber wars have been successful, even if they invite Israel or other states to respond to Iranian aggression using The same or better cyber means.”CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSome experts have also asserted that Iran’s reignition of the quiet fight with Israel last month was in response to Israel’s frequent targeting of Iran-backed, Hezbollah assets in Syria.“(The cyber conflict) will not end anytime soon. The cyberattack that Iran launched on Israel's water infrastructure was a convenient and relatively low-risk way to retaliate against recent (presumed) Israeli strikes on Iranian targets in Syria,” added Heather Heldman, managing partner of Luminae Group and a former Middle East advisor at the US State Department. “Regardless of the fact that Iran's cyberattack failed to cause significant damage or disruption inside Israel, it gave the Iranian regime an opportunity to score points with its domestic audience and distract from the turmoil transpiring at home, which has intensified in the wake of Coronavirus and low oil prices.”"
Teen left orphaned after murder-suicide earns $120G college scholarship through golf caddying,Proud American,Michael Ruiz,2020-05-22,"An Ohio teen who was left orphaned after a murder-suicide eight years ago has earned herself a full college scholarship to attend The Ohio State University through hard work in the classroom -- and as a caddy on the golf course.Caroline Jarrell was 10 years old and watching the Disney Channel when she heard four gunshots ring out into the night outside her father’s home.It was 8:04 p.m. on Jan. 10, 2012 -- a time she said has always stuck in her mind.Her parents were divorced. And her mother had arrived to pick up the children from a stay with their father, she told Fox News.Caroline was the first of her siblings to venture out after the noise. She found their mother’s body in the driveway, in her car with the family dog. Her father was dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound nearby.“I didn’t know what was going on,” she said Thursday. “I just knew that something bad had happened.”She remembers seeing blood, trying to talk to her mom, and a neighbor calling 911. Much of the rest of the night condensed into a blur.“It was just chaotic for everyone,” she said.Her grandparents, Dennis and Linda Pawlecki, as well as her mother’s brother Michael Pawlecki, drove over an hour that night to be with the children.“They were really helpful that night,” Jarrell said. “They helped calm me down, even though they were going through everything.”The Jarrell children stayed in their mother’s house the rest of that school year, with frequent visits from the Pawleckis. Then they moved in with their grandparents in Toledo, Ohio.Next semester, Jarrell is headed to The Ohio State University on a full ride thanks to the Evans Scholars Foundation, named for Charles “Chick” Evans Jr., a famed amateur golfer who set up the program with the Western Golf Association in 1930.Nick, the oldest of the Jarrell children, had already been caddying before they came to Ohio, at his mother’s urging. It was in an effort to earn that same scholarship.In Toledo, one of the first things he did was find a new caddying job at the famed Inverness Club, Caroline said. He eventually received the Evans Scholarship and went to The Ohio State University. Now he’s an English teacher in Cincinnati.Ellyn Jarrell, the middle child, earned herself her own Evans Scholarship -- and she’s still attending the University of Notre Dame, where their mother went to college.Following in the footsteps of her older siblings, Caroline started caddying at Inverness in the summer after eighth grade. She said it’s the only job she’s ever had.Now, she’s also achieved the Evans Scholarship.Working at Inverness, she met her future Ohio State roommate, Kelcy -- who is yet another Evans recipient.The Evans Scholarship covers full tuition and housing costs for “high-achieving caddies with limited financial means,” according to the foundation. That amounts to an estimated $120,000 per recipient. The Evans Scholars Program says it has paid out $410 million in scholarships overall.The scholarships receive financial support from tens of thousands of Par Club donors, as well as the WGA’s BMW Championship, which is a PGA Tour FedEx Cup playoff event.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPRecipients show good grades, financial need, “outstanding character” and a strong caddie record.At Ohio State, Caroline said she will study social work -- a career path she chose because of the social worker who helped her keep it together when she dealt her parents’ divorce as a child.“She was the first person who, besides my mom and my siblings, who just made me feel heard,” Jarrell said Thursday. “I just wanted to be that person for someone else, to help them feel like they’re not alone.”"
'Wear blue: run to remember' military families group goes 'virtual' this Memorial Day amid coronavirus,Proud American,Brooke Singman,2020-05-21,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.This year’s Memorial Day will look a little different for the “wear blue: run to remember” community amid the coronavirus pandemic, but that won’t stop them from running “for the fallen; for the fighting; for families.”The executive director and co-founder of “wear blue: run to remember,” Lisa Hallett, has taken the organization’s annual Memorial Day activities virtual in an effort to continue her organization’s mission, even through the COVID-19 crisis.“The unique circumstances of 2020 find us isolated from most facets of group life,” Hallett told Fox News. “Changes to the way we attend school, work and our place of worship have challenged most of us, but during this time, it has never been more important for us to meaningfully come together.”""The atypical circumstances of 2020 will not prevent us from achieving our mission on Memorial Day – to honor our nation’s fallen by learning their stories, speaking their names and honoring their legacies,"" the organization's website states. ""We invite you, your families and friends to join us, virtually, in honoring our fallen service members and their families’ sacrifice.""“wear blue” is a nonprofit running community honoring the service and sacrifice of the American military. The community “unites and supports military and their families, veterans, Gold Star families, and civilians through active remembrance and meaningful relationships.” The organization works to act as a support network, serve as a living memorial and bridge the gap between military and civilian communities.“wear blue is virtual for Memorial Day,” Hallett told Fox News. ""We have intentionally partnered with Team Red White and Blue and other like minded organizations to build a robust, and united effort to honor the fallen and support the military during this time of separation.”Hallett told Fox News that “wear blue” and Team RWB are “calling on our nation to come together in shared steps outside of our back doors.”“Our goal is 50,000 runners committed to running or walking in honor of the fallen,” Hallett said, noting that the organization has also partnered with Amazon, VISA and more to make the event happen. “We recognize that now, more than ever, we are stronger together.”Hallett told Fox News that “Amazon and its 25,000 military veterans joined 'wear blue' in creating a virtual training program as part of a stay healthy-stay connected campaign that we developed together.”“Amazon employees have been sharing their weekly training and preparing to run a 5k this Memorial Day,” Hallett told Fox News. “We are excited to partner with them, and grateful for their generous support of our programming.”A spokesperson for Amazon confirmed to Fox News the company's involvement.Hallett added that VISA also had a military and veteran network and “is joining us in running this Memorial Day.”This Memorial Day, Hallett invited runners, walkers and supporters to download the “Motigo” app, which will feature messages from families of the fallen, and fellow service members, sharing stories about their loved ones and what Memorial Day means to them.Participation is at no cost, Hallett told Fox News, saying that runners, walkers and supporters “simply commit a meaningful number of miles to run or walk or move on Memorial Day.”“On Memorial Day, we ask that our community shares their honored hero with others on their social media channels, with the challenge, for the examples and motivation of these heroes to live in how we live,” Hallett said.Meanwhile, in 2017, “wear blue” launched a program dedicated to Gold Star children called the “wear blue Gold Star Youth Mentorship Program,” which pairs active duty military with children of fallen service members.This year, Gold Star children, with the support of the USAA Foundation, have been training virtually to run a Memorial Day 5K.“Each week, we join a Zoom call, and discuss training tips and setting and achieving smart goals,” Hallett told Fox News. “They are running for purposeful steps on Memorial Day in honor of their fallen parents.”Hallett explained that on Memorial Day, runners will be invited to join a “Zoom Circle of Remembrance,” and then will begin to walk or run in honor of their fallen hero.AMERICA TOGETHER: MORE STORIES OF THE AMERICAN SPIRIT“I am proud of 'wear blue: run to remember' and Team RWB, as we join our communities in a nationwide effort to honor and remember our fallen military heroes on this Memorial Day,” Hallett told Fox News. “On Monday, May 25, we will speak the names and share the stories of the men and women who volunteered to serve their countries and gave the last full measure in doing so. And in this act, we are reminded of our potential and our call to rise.”“wear blue” originally was founded following the redeployment of 5-2 Stryker Brigade Combat Team, a unit that, while deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, sustained a significant amount of combat losses and casualties. During that deployment, a small group of 5-2 wives and battalion support staff met weekly to run, seeking to create a support network for one another. When the brigade returned, Hallett, and co-founder, Erin O’Connor, turned the small group into a nationwide vision.Hallett told Fox News that the program has had a very personal impact on her family. Her husband, Capt. John Hallett, was killed on Aug. 25, 2009, just three weeks after the birth of their third child, Heidi, and just six weeks after his deployment with 5th Stryker Brigade to Shah Wali Kot district in Kandahar. Capt. Hallett was killed when his unit encountered an improvised explosive device.“It’s been over 10 years since my husband Capt. John Hallett was killed in combat. Our three children are growing up … they are anxious to hear the stories of the young adult they are striving to become — stories of John that often feel too far away,” Hallett explained.“In military service, there is not always the space to tell the stories of our fallen friends and leaders,” she continued. “As community members, there are not always words strong enough to say thank you, or I am sorry for your loss. But on Memorial Day, our steps become the words and the stories.”Hallett added that as her children grow up “it’s bittersweet to see John on their faces and in their actions, as well as their own desires to know the man they barely met.”CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP“I’m grateful for this day that we share with our country our pride,” she said. “And they share with us their strength and remembrance.”“When I look at the streets across America, and I witness a nation moving in red, white and blue, I know that you remember. I know that you care, and I know that John's legacy and the legacies of all our fallen endure in how we live,” Hallett said. “We must now, more than ever, hold steady to the charge to live a life worthy of such sacrifices.”o join this no-cost virtual walk or run in honor of our nation's fallen military, please visit https://www.wearblueruntoremember.org/."
Court sides with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer after GOP lawmakers challenge her coronavirus restrictions,Gretchen Whitmer,Morgan Phillips,2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.The Michigan Court of Claims ruled Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has the authority to keep her state under a state of emergency without legislative approval, after GOP lawmakers challenged her extension of sweeping restrictions.Republicans in the House and Senate were frustrated with Whitmer’s one-size strategy to stop the spread of coronavirus by keeping people home and shutting businesses in regions minimally affected by the virus and far from the state’s epicenter, the Detroit area.The legislature did not approve the extension of Whitmer’s emergency declaration but she enacted it anyway, extending the stay-at-home order until May 28 but loosening some restrictions. On May 18, Whitmer allowed retail businesses, bars and restaurants in two regions to open at a limited capacity.And while gatherings are discouraged, groups of 10 or fewer will not be cited for gathering.The judge said a 1945 law, cited by Whitmer, is not limited to local and regional emergencies only but can be used on a statewide level.MICHIGAN BARBERS, HAIRDRESSERS GIVE FREE HAIRCUTS AT CAPITOL IN DEFIANCE OF WHITMER'S LOCKDOWNThe legislature said Whitmer violated the law, which says lawmakers get a role in emergency declarations lasting longer than 28 days. Indeed, the judge said the governor can't use that law to extend emergencies without input from lawmakers. But Whitmer won the case anyway.“It would take a particularly strained reading of the plain text of the [law] to conclude that a grant of authority to deal with a public crisis that affects all the people of this state would somehow be constrained to a certain locality,” Judge Cynthia Stephens said.The claims are “meritless,” she said.Stephens' decision was a third time that a Court of Claims judge ruled in the governor's favor. The other lawsuits were brought by residents, a business owner and a new group that has organized protests at the Capitol.CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGEThe House and Senate promised to appeal the ruling. Republican leaders took some comfort that the judge said Whitmer can't use the '76 law to unilaterally make emergency declarations.The governor’s office responded postiviely to the result.“She will continue to do what she’s always done: take careful, decisive actions to protect Michiganders from this unprecedented, global pandemic,” Whitmer's office said in a written statement.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
Tokyo Olympics followed up by 3 mega-events -- all in China,Olympics,,2020-05-22,"Uncertainty grips next year’s postponed Tokyo Olympics: Will there be fans or empty stadiums in 14 months? And how will thousands of athletes, staff, and technical officials travel, be housed, and stay safe amid COVID-19?And Tokyo is not alone.China — where the COVID-19 outbreak was first detected — will hold three mega-sports events within a year after Tokyo is set to close.CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COMThe World University Games in Chengdu in western China open 10 days after the Tokyo Games close, with up to 8,000 athletes. Next come the Beijing Winter Olympics beginning on Feb. 4, 2022, and the Asian Games in Hangzhou starting on Sept. 10. The previous edition of the Asian Games in Indonesia drew 11,000 athletes and featured more sports than the Olympics.A fourth major event, soccer’s 24-team Club World Championship, was to open in China in June of 2021, but has been postponed because of scheduling conflicts created by the pandemic.China is a go-to country for these mega events, through expertise gained from the 2008 Beijing Olympics and because it absorbs the massive costs. It spent at least $40 billion to organize the 2008 Olympics, and there was no national debate since the authoritarian state prohibits voting or referendums.Voters in Europe and North America have repeatedly said “no” to referendums to hold the games. China landed the 2022 Winter Olympics when several European bidders withdrew. Beijing won narrowly in a vote by the IOC against Almaty, Kazakhstan.“Telling the citizens of Bavaria or Switzerland that another Winter Olympics would benefit them greatly doesn’t work,” Jonathan Grix, who studies sports policy at Manchester Metropolitan University, wrote in an email. He said voters sense that “citizens rarely benefit the most from such events.”“Authoritarian states have no need to ask the populace, they have no need to compromise on policy, there is no political opposition (by definition) and most delivery services are state-run, ensuring the smooth running of the event,“ Grix added.Japanese and International Olympic Committee officials have given few details about how the Tokyo Olympics will be staged, the cost of postponement, and who will pay for it. They’ve teased the problems and floated tenuous solutions. They’ve agreed on one thing: If the games can’t open on July 23, 2021, they’ll be canceled.In a joint news conference last weekend, the director general of the World Health Organization cautioned it would not be “easy” to make the Olympics a safe global gathering spot.But Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed confidence: “I think it’s possible,”IOC President Thomas Bach has been cautious in speculating how the Olympics can be held. He’s suggested a possible quarantine for athletes, hinted at limited fan access to venues, and has not ruled out events in empty stadiums. Of course, he says that’s not his preference.IOC member John Coates, who oversees preparations for Tokyo, has been direct.“We’ve got real problems because we’ve got athletes having to come from 206 different nations,” Coates said, speaking at a News Corp Australia digital forum and reported in The Australian newspaper. “We’ve got 11,000 athletes coming, 5,000 technical officials and coaches, 20,000 media."" There's also about 4,000 working on the organizing committee and an expected 60,000 volunteers.""Some scientists in Japan and elsewhere believe a vaccine is needed to guarantee safety for athletes. But some have asked if young, healthy athletes should be a priority for vaccination.The biggest challenge might be guaranteeing the safety of fans who have already bought millions of tickets. If there are no fans, will there be refunds? Will there be lawsuits? Tickets provide at least $800 million income for local organizers with the added cost of postponement estimated in Japan at $2 billion to $6 billion.Eric Saintrond, the CEO of the FISU — the Switzerland-based governing body of the World University Games — said in an email to The Associated Press that decisions related to “security and health will be taken” by the Chinese government. He said final decisions in this area do “not in fact rest with FISU.” He said all preparations were “on track.”University Games spokesman Wang Guangliang was asked about housing for athletes, fans, and so forth, but offered little clarity, deflecting back to the FISU.“The impact of the pandemic is still unforeseeable and we are still studying the situation and need to discuss with FISU about what to do to reduce the impact and ensure the safety of all participants,” Wang wrote in a email to the AP.Postponing the Summer Olympics by a year has raised questions about marketing the Winter Olympics, which open six months after Tokyo closes. Construction is on schedule, but sponsors may face challenges.“Sponsors and business partners of the games will have to keep investing extra money in their marketing programs for Tokyo if the games are postponed, potentially forcing them to reduce their budgets for the next Olympics,” Wei Jizhong, a former secretary general of the Chinese Olympic Committee, told the China Daily.The Associated Press emailed questions about Beijing 2022 preparations to Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC vice president who oversees Beijing preparations. He did not immediately reply to the request, nor to a follow-up. Beijing could also face the issues of athlete quarantines, fewer fans, and the fear of spreading the virus even more.In an interview in February with China’s official Xinhua News Agency, Samaranch was laudatory about preparations. He praised Beijing organizers, President Xi Jinping, who heads of the Chinese Communist Party, and China’s handling of the virus.Sheena Greitens, who studies Asian politics at the University of Texas at Austin, said large sports events give China high visibility and “can keep reporters focused on the sporting events rather than having them use their time in-country to dig around on other topics that might reflect poorly on the CCP (Chinese Communist Party).”“They provide a way for China to boost its cultural and ‘discourse power’ globally,” Greitens wrote in an email. “And they do so in a forum that generally emphasizes international cooperation and is weighted away from the serious disagreements that many countries have with China over territorial conflict, human rights, and trade, among other topics.”"

""Online apps such as GRUBHUB ARE CHARGING US 30% of each order and $9 or more on orders made using phone numbers on their app or website … please help save the restaurant industry by ordering directly with us,” the note read, NBC News reported.Restaurants are pleading with their customers to order directly from their business pages instead of turning to the convenience of delivery apps. Some have even begun offering special deals available to those that order from them directly.Chain restaurant Bareburger started advertising its specials “only available on bareburger.com.” It also placed signage urging people to “support your local restaurants & order directly with them,” according to the outlet.FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWSMesa Pizza Co. also took out ads slamming Grubhub and asking customers to call them directly.“When the delivery platform takes 30 percent, it means almost all restaurants that are using the delivery platforms are running at break-even or actually at a loss for every time you place an order.” — Travis Stoliker, co-owner of Saddleback BBQ“How it works is the delivery platforms come into a market, and they usually start by putting all of the restaurants’ menus on their platforms,” Travis Stoliker, co-owner of Saddleback BBQ in Lansing, Mich., told the Lansing State Journal. ""They basically scrape the Internet, find our menus and they list us and they create essentially websites that are about our restaurant. And they haven’t gotten permission to do that.""“When the delivery platform takes 30 percent, it means almost all restaurants that are using the delivery platforms are running at break-even or actually at a loss for every time you place an order,"" Stoliker added.Grubhub denies the allegations, instead blaming high rent and taxes -- not Grubhub's commission fees, which it says are used for delivery costs and marketing.""Grubhub is neither a public utility nor simply a delivery service. In the simplest of terms, Grubhub is a marketing engine and an order generation business -- connecting hungry diners to great, local restaurants,"" a spokesperson for Grubhub said in a statement to Fox News.""The platform is free for any restaurant owner who chooses to join, and Grubhub offers a fee-for-service model, meaning that restaurant owners select the services they want and only pay when Grubhub generates a sale. Restaurants have many options to drive business besides third-party marketplaces, none of which are seeing their fees regulated.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPCities have moved to cap fees that delivery companies can charge. DoorDash even cut its commission fees in half, and Uber Eats says it stopped charging delivery fees for more than 100,000 independent restaurants in an effort to help.The caps, which have been implemented in several cities across the U.S., have been vehemently opposed by Grubhub, claiming they would hinder restaurants' earnings.""On the face of it, a cap on fees seems to be an easy solution to help restaurants that are struggling due to the coronavirus. And there is nothing we want more than to ensure the health of independent restaurants -- we don’t have a business without them,"" the statement read.""But this solution is exactly the wrong thing to do. In reality, this proposed cap will lower order volume to locally-owned restaurants, increase costs -- and headaches -- for small business owners, and raise costs to customers. Delivery workers, who are currently relying on Grubhub to earn an income including 100 percent of tips from diners, would have fewer work opportunities and lower earnings. In the middle of what is quickly becoming one of the worst economic downturns in a century, Grubhub is ensuring that workers in New York City can continue to provide for themselves and their families.""A spokesperson for DoorDash did not respond to requests for comment."
RNC Chair McDaniel: Democrats and voter fraud in Nevada — here's how it will impact you,OPINION,Ronna McDaniel,2020-05-22,"Democrats say they want more “inclusive” voting practices. They fail to mention just how inclusive their plans are: sending ballots to dead voters.Nevada is a case study of the lengths Democrats will go to secure a voting edge.First Marc Elias and Perkins Coie sued the state on behalf of Democrat groups, demanding election officials break laws against ballot harvesting, ignore signature verification requirements and send ballots to inactive voters the state believes moved away. They demanded more in-person voting locations while arguing voting in person was too dangerous for the June 9 mail-in vote primary.VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: CORONAVIRUS DEEPENS DIVISIONS — EXCEPT MAYBE THIS ONE BIT OF COMMON GROUNDThe message was sent, and Democrats in Clark County got in line. A new voting plan was reached “shrouded in mystery,” according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Officials would now increase the number of in-person voting locations in the Democrat-heavy region, mail ballots to all “voters” and allow “field registrars,” commonly known as ballot harvesters, to pick them up. All at the expense of taxpayers of $323,000, and the rule of law.The result has made Clark County look more like Tammany Hall. What is unfolding should concern every American.Weeks before the election, live ballots are piling up at apartment complexes. Others are found in the trash. The Review-Journal reported one postal worker has already found thousands of ballots that are “no good,” just “sitting in crates with no additional safeguards.” Jenny Trobiani, who has worked for the U.S. Postal Service for over three decades, said the ballots were for residents who “had all moved or died.” She even received one in the mail for her deceased mother.Dozens of ballots are being found pinned to community bulletin boards. “From Friday to Monday, I could have voted 20 times,” said one resident of an apartment complex in Las Vegas. “That’s what’s so concerning about all this.”Who is to stop a Democrat “field registrar” from picking them up, signing them and dropping them off? That sounds outrageous. But it is what Democrat groups are seeking in their lawsuit.Trained poll officials would no longer be able to throw out fraudulent ballots that do not match their signature on file. Instead, the lawsuit would prohibit what it calls the “dubious art of signature matching” and circumvent Nevada’s ballot harvesting ban. Signature matching is so “dubious” it has been required for every new voter registration in Nevada and used to verify every voter who shows up at the polls for years.This is not unique to Nevada. Democrats are attacking the integrity of our elections across the country and circling the wagons.Democrats are welcoming voter fraud in Nevada. And they are not even hiding it.The Elias lawsuit is explicit. It states the statewide ban on ballot harvesting “hamstrings” the ability of Democrat groups, including the Democratic National Committee, the Nevada State Democratic Party, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Priorities USA, to “assist voters in making the transition to vote by mail.”Democrats are happy to “assist,” as long as you vote Democrat.This is not unique to Nevada. Democrats are attacking the integrity of our elections across the country and circling the wagons.From Planned Parenthood to the Center for American Progress, left-wing activist groups are pushing the same false talking points that while we flatten the curve we must upend our elections. Voting must be more “inclusive” (by adopting liberal policies).Nancy Pelosi’s $3 trillion bill would launch a federal takeover of our elections, all in line with Elias’ lawsuits in 29 states. Their mission is to nationalize ballot harvesting, gut signature verification and voter ID laws and send millions of ballots to voters who have died or moved away, before November.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThat's why the Republican National Committee and Trump campaign have launched our Protect the Vote effort, a digital platform which spotlights our efforts to protect against the Democrats' assault on our elections as they push for sweeping changes, including vote-by-mail and more ballot harvesting amid the coronavirus pandemicThe opportunity for fraud with these Democrat proposals is enormous. There are over 200,000 inactive voters in Clark County alone. Inactive voters are given the opportunity to update their registrations and can still request a ballot in the upcoming election. Individuals are only deemed inactive after the state receives evidence from the Postal Service that they have moved.“Knowingly mailing a ballot to a wrong address is bad enough,” a Review-Journal editorial recently argued. “Combining that with the elimination of signature verification is an open invitation to shenanigans and makes absolutely no sense.”CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThat’s why this week I sent a letter to Nevada Attorney General Aaron D. Ford requesting an investigation into Clark County’s backroom deal, and potential violations of state election and open meeting laws. Democrat officials in Clark County did not allow any public input before unilaterally upending its election procedures.Our elections must be free, fair and secure. They should not enable voter fraud at the taxpayers’ expense.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RONNA MCDANIEL"
"Rep. Roger Marshall, M.D.: WHO desperately needs reform – here’s how to protect global health now",OPINION,"Rep. Roger Marshall, M.D.",2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.For the last 70 years, the U.S. and countries around the world have put their trust in the World Health Organization (WHO) to alert the global community of disease outbreaks and provide technical expertise in public health. In return, the WHO has – time and again – demonstrated its systemic organizational problems and lack of accountability.The COVID-19 pandemic is just one more example of the WHO’s willingness to let politics govern over their core responsibility as a global public health watchdog.As a physician, I’m especially concerned about the WHO’s failure to properly respond to these outbreaks. Nearly 100,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, and this international health organization must be held to strict medical and information sharing standards going forward.AVELLA AND DUGAN: GEORGIA VS. CORONAVIRUS — THESE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCEDecisions by the WHO guide and impact the abilities of medical providers to provide proper guidance and care for their patients.The director-general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom, made several disastrous mistakes in mitigating and preventing the COVID-19 outbreak. On Jan. 14, the Chinese government denied human-to-human transmission of the virus was occurring, and the WHO quickly endorsed their message. It’s shocking that the WHO made no attempt to independently verify the claims of an undemocratic government widely known for its iron muzzle on the media, the “Great Firewall” of Internet controls, and an unapologetic history of concealing the truth.Then again, this easy solidarity with China is no surprise when considering Tedros was largely backed by China when seeking the WHO’s top position. More notably, his home country is one of Africa’s leading partners for China’s “Belt and Road Initiative” and China remains their largest source of foreign investment.Politics, unfortunately, had much to do with the Tedros decision to state that the Chinese response to the outbreak was “transparent” and had his full confidence. As Tedros was helping the Chinese government, hospitals across Wuhan became overwhelmed by sick patients while Chinese officials silenced the medical community with one hand, and stockpiled personal protective equipment with the other.However, thanks to unwavering international pressure, Tedros declared the outbreak a public health emergency and changed course.It is time to reevaluate the organizational structure of the WHO to ensure future responses are based on science, not propaganda.It’s doubtful the WHO would have reacted differently without Tedros catering to China. This isn’t the organization’s first failure at responding to a disease outbreak. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic sparked heavy criticism of the WHO’s poor performance and prompted many external and internal investigations calling for reform. While some reform measures have been adopted, WHO continues to lack accountability, and without it, medical expertise and public health will always come second to politics and propaganda.Independent investigations of the COVID-19 outbreak will undoubtedly be written and recommendations for reform will be outlined. Minor technical changes will be adopted and the ones threatening political favor will be ignored. In order to ensure meaningful changes are actually made, countries need to abandon the carrot and grab the stick.The U.S. is the largest volunteer contributor to the WHO, and with these persistent problems, the Trump administration rightly decided to halt funding pending an investigation into its handling of the COVID-19 outbreak.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERAs the Trump administration continues to pry open political motivations driving the WHO, over 60 countries, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, as well as the European Union, have signed a resolution backing the investigation. That resolution was recently adopted unanimously during a virtual meeting of the World Health Assembly, despite repeated complaints from China.It is time to reevaluate the organizational structure of the WHO to ensure future responses are based on science, not propaganda.Participating countries should consider establishing a small select voting body of medical experts, similar to the structure of the United Nations Security Council, with the purpose of championing cooperation in solving global health issues. This body could oversee significant policy issues like outbreaks, major capital expenditures, and assess actions taken by other countries during public health emergencies.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAccountability comes with the power to make decisions that member states are then obligated to implement. This would be supplemented with international pressure.The U.S. — the largest single provider of humanitarian assistance, the largest contributor to the WHO, and global watchdog — must lead this fight to ensure the WHO fulfills its role in global health and pandemic response.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP.

Rep. Mike Gallagher: Is Congress nonessential? It's acting that way — but here's how we can fix that,OPINION,Mike Gallagher | Fox News,2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.The coronavirus crisis has forced all Americans to ask the question: what are the essential and non-essential things in our lives?Amid this debate, as Americans struggle to survive the shutdown and as our country struggles to avoid a prolonged recession, it is odd that Congress, through its actions, would openly declare itself nonessential. Congress has, after all, not congressed in any meaningful sense for over two months.During this time the largest spending bill in American history passed without amendments or a recorded vote. Last week Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., passed a rule allowing Congress to stay out of session until mid-July and a proxy voting proposal that would undo centuries of precedent and allow the speaker to pass legislation with less than 25 out of 435 members present.AVELLA AND DUGAN: GEORGIA VS. CORONAVIRUS — THESE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCEIn other words, approximately 5 percent of the members of Congress are essential and the rest of us are nonessential.These developments should not come as a surprise. They are essentially the culmination of decades of dereliction of constitutional duty by Congress. We have gone from the Framers fearing that the legislature would necessarily predominate and suck everything into its impetuous vortex to the current situation where Congress has decided, like a character in the film ""Office Space,"" that it is not going to quit, it is just going to stop going to work.What little power remains in the increasingly powerless institution is in the hands of an increasingly small number of people at the top of the legislative hierarchy. As I wrote two years ago reflecting on my first term in Congress: “I have come to believe that the problem (with Congress) is not the people. The problem is a defective process and a power structure that, whichever party is in charge, funnels all power to leadership and stifles debate and initiative within the ranks…“Leadership determines which bills come to the floor for a vote, leadership chooses loyal committee chairs so as to ensure that bills opposed by special interests will be killed in committee, and in the event that problematic amendments do make it to the House floor, the Rules Committee — an organ of the speaker — kills them off. The legislation that does pass tends to come in last-second omnibus bills that legislators have no chance to read, let alone debate and amend.”Two years later, the problem has gotten even worse. House Democratic leadership no longer need to rely on such subtle tactics to stifle debate and force rank-and-file members to cast up or down votes on multi-trillion dollar legislative packages: they now can simply keep us outside of Washington, D.C., and call a few of us back whenever the speaker needs their votes.How do we fix Congress? A good start would be to end the vacation and reconvene in person,President Obama said last weekend, “This pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge don’t know what they’re doing. A lot of them aren’t even pretending to be in charge.” I assume he was talking about Congress under Pelosi’s leadership. If so, I have to say what I don’t often say: I agree with President Obama.I know some conservatives might be tempted to think Congress’ inability to pass laws is a net positive. Yet the opposite is true. A feckless Congress further empowers unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats in the executive branch and activist judges in the judicial branch. A weak Congress passing complex, unreadable, 1,000-page bills written by a small group of staffers empowers special interests and fortifies the status quo against meaningful reform.A functional Congress is, in other words, essential. It is essential now more than ever.At a time when we are rapidly spending trillions of dollars that we do not have to combat coronavirus, Congress has to do oversight to ensure this money is having a positive impact.As we ramp up domestic manufacturing of PPE, it will require legislation passed by Congress to strengthen our medical supply chains and thereby wean America off of our dangerous dependency on cheap Chinese goods.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERAs we confront relentless Chinese Communist Party propaganda, Congress must come together and figure out a foundation for winning this New Cold War.How do we fix Congress? A good start would be to end the vacation and reconvene in person, for at least two weeks, so that we can start to do our committee work, which cannot be done by proxy. This should in turn lead to an enduring change in the congressional schedule, where we end this foolish practice of flying in and out of town each week for meaningless votes.While we are at it, Democrats should join the newly launched China Task Force so Congress can reassert its role U.S. foreign policy and send a strong signal of support to our friends in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang suffering from coercion and oppression by the Chinese Communist Party.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt would also be a good idea to drain the pesky swamp that seems to just get swampier. Eventually this means we will need a complete overhaul and simplification of the budget committee and appropriations process. But for now, let’s start small with a simple prohibition on former members of Congress lobbying on behalf of foreign entities.As we emerge from the coronavirus crisis, Congress must reclaim its rightful constitutional authority. Nothing could be more essential.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP. MIKE GALLAGHER"

"Baby pygmy hippo born at San Diego Zoo, conquers the internet with cuteness",Mammals,Mindy Weisberger - Senior Writer | LiveScience,2020-05-22,"The San Diego Zoo recently announced its newest (and arguably cutest) arrival: a newborn male pygmy hippo, born on April 9 to its 4-year-old pygmy hippo mama Mabel.Within hours of birth, the very tubby youngster was standing up and following its mother around, toddling after her in the hippos' indoor habitat, zoo representatives said in a statement.The baby, which has not yet been named, weighed 12.4 lbs. (5.6 kilograms) at birth and now weighs about 25 lbs. (11 kg). This is the first successful pygmy hippo birth at the zoo in more than three decades, offering hope for the future of this endangered species, according to the statement.Related: Photos: World's cutest baby wild animalsIn the maternity ""ward"" of the hippo habitat, the calf now has access to a pool, after first testing the waters in a shallow tub. Over the last few weeks, the baby demonstrated that it was able to close its nostrils and hold its breath underwater.As their name implies, pygmy hippos (Choeropsis liberiensis) are significantly smaller than river hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius), according to the San Diego Zoo. Adult pygmy hippos weigh about 350 to 600 lbs. (160 to 270 kg), while river hippos can weigh up to 10 times more. The heads of pygmy hippos are also blunter and rounder than those of their bigger hippo cousins, and pygmy hippos' eyes are located on the sides of their heads rather than at the top.Pygmy hippos often look shiny and slick even when they aren't in the water, thanks to a pinkish fluid called ""blood sweat"" that oozes from their skin. This liquid acts like a moisturizing sunscreen; it keeps their skin from drying and cracking in the heat and protects the hippos from sunburn, according to the zoo.Fewer than 2,500 pygmy hippos remain in their native habitats in West Africa, where they live in forest rivers in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire.Mabel and her calf will remain separated from the calf's father, a 13-year-old named Elgon, as pygmy hippos do not typically live together as families, zoo representatives said. In about a month, the baby and his mother will emerge from their seclusion in the indoor enclosure and will begin taking turns with Elgon to spend time in the main hippo habitat.Originally published on Live Science."
Lori Loughlin’s career and image could be ‘tainted’ after guilty plea in college admissions scandal: expert,Exclusive,Julius Young,2020-05-22,"Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, have agreed to plead guilty in the college admissions scandal case that loomed over them for more than a year.Although the date of their expected guilty plea has not yet been determined, the Massachusetts District Attorney’s Office announced on Thursday that Loughlin will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, while Giannulli will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and to honest services wire and mail fraud.If the judge accepts the terms of their plea agreement, both will do time in prison. Loughlin would serve two months and pay a $150,000 fine along with two years of supervised release and 100 hours of community service. Giannulli, meanwhile, would serve five months in prison, pay a $250,000 fine with two years of supervised release and 250 hours of community service.LORI LOUGHLIN MUST PREPARE FOR ‘TRIAL OF HER LIFE’ AFTER JUDGE REFUSES TO DISMISS CHARGES, LEGAL EXPERT SAYSNow, with the big hurdle seemingly behind the “Full House” alum, many questions remain as to whether Loughlin will be able to bounce back and salvage her career in show business and if the public will be able to see past her transgressions moving forward.“Hollywood tends to be pretty forgiving if it's a nonviolent crime and also it depends on the times we're living in. We're in a time where there's a lot of cheating and a lot of corruption and things going on that are very telling about people,” KerrPR President Cherie Kerr, who is not involved in the case, told Fox News on Thursday soon after the plea agreements were announced.LORI LOUGHLIN'S 'FULL HOUSE' CO-STAR DAVE COULIER SAYS HE 'WILL BE THERE FOR HER FOREVER' AMID SCANDAL DRAMAThe personal and corporate crisis manager continued: “For instance, the fact that [Lori] lied about both daughters' athletic ability – that's a real problem. That's worse than her just sending somebody some money as an influence and to get [her daughters] in and then say, 'Oh well, I didn't really know what I was doing and this guy [William 'Rick' Singer] put himself out to be someone who was just a coordinator to get my kids in school. So when you start lying as she did about her daughters and their background – and they found out they weren't rowers – that's the problem because that's really deceitful.”Kerr believes that Loughlin “should have walked off the field long ago” as her former co-defendant in the elaborate admissions scheme, actress Felicity Huffman, elected to do early on in the case before prosecutors put the squeeze on the remaining parents. Huffman served 11 of the 14 days handed to her and began completing her court-mandated community service back in November 2019.“She didn't fight it and get off and even if she had, there was a lot of damage done,” Kerr said. “It's generally not just one thing, but I think her career and her image is tainted from here on out because of what happened. If she's not well thought of as a mother, to a lot of people in the public that will be a big black mark against her.”Kerr said Loughlin should get ahead of the matter in the media, if permitted by the terms of her plea agreement, and should explain her reasoning behind making the large payments and staging the photos of her daughters -- Olivia Jade Giannulli and Isabella Giannulli -- for their admittance into the University of Southern California.LORI LOUGHLIN ‘OUTRAGED,’ DAUGHTER OLIVIA JADE ‘EMBARRASSED’ BY PROSECUTORS RELEASING ROWING PICS, REPORTS SAY“What happens with the press is that whoever has the most ink or airtime is the one where the public's sway is moved toward that side, but if she's not going to say anything and she's not going to do anything, I think she's going to have a problem,” said Kerr.“So if she has any kind of defense – if she wants to do a mea culpa or she wants to say this is really what went down and how it went down – we were desperate or whatever – she should be out there talking,” Kerr maintained. “Some people just decide to go away and leave it alone for a while. But I always say, if the story's out there and you made a deal and that's what you did and you have a way to explain that away – then do it.”“People used to go on with Barbara Walters for a whole hour and explain why they did what they did,” Kerr added.Prominent San Diego criminal defense attorney David Shapiro, also not attached to the matter, echoed the sentiment of Kerr that Loughlin’s chances of coming away victorious were slim and believes that a portion of the general public will scoff at the two months in federal prison Loughlin may have to serve behind bars if the judge accepts the terms of the plea agreement.LORI LOUGHLIN'S PLEA AGREEMENT: WHAT THE TERMS MEAN“Lori Loughlin’s fate was likely sealed, one way or the other, well before this guilty plea,” said Shapiro. “Some in the general public may not be happy with anything short of a lengthy prison commitment. She absolutely appears to have cheated the system, but got caught and now is labeled a felon.”“Only time shall tell what Loughlin’s legacy will be,” he added. “Many will remember her as ‘Aunt Becky’ from ‘Full House,’ and nothing more. Others will view this [pending] conviction as a black eye she can never recover from. Others will look back and see a mother who was willing to risk it all for the good of her children, albeit via illegal means.”However, current white-collar criminal defense attorney Michael Zweiback – who is a former Assistant U.S. Attorney and prosecutor in the Central District of California and is also not involved in the legal proceedings – takes the opposite view of Kerr, and while he’s sure that ""the stain will require a significant amount of time” for the matter to cycle out of the news, Loughlin “will have an opportunity to resume her career at some point.”“A lot depends upon how she acts from this point forward. Is she showing remorse? Does the narrative change from her being a victim of an overzealous government prosecution to ‘I am sorry for my actions?’"" Zweiback explained to Fox News on Thursday. “The judge will look to that when determining whether to accept this agreement and sentence her accordingly. [And] the public will also be watching for this.”OLIVIA JADE: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT LORI LOUGHLIN’S DAUGHTER AT THE CENTER OF THE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDALMeanwhile, considering the current happenings in the world and whether the ongoing coronavirus pandemic will hurt or help Loughlin’s ability to gain favor with the public, Kerr said there's a slippery slope to navigate in the fact that people may be so involved in their own life dealings that the outcome of the scandal could be eclipsed.“Well, that can play out on both sides. They can say, 'Yeah, who cares? We're in a much more serious situation and all she did was send some money and photos and got her kids in the school she wanted them to go to. That pales in comparison to what's happening otherwise,'"" Kerr explained. “But then they can also have a lot more time to sit and watch television and look at the news coverage because they're not working. So it can work both ways.”Kerr also anticipates that there will be a number of factors that will come into play on whether the scandal will define Loughlin and if Hollywood decides they’re willing to take a gamble on the fallen star.“That's really hard to say because it depends on what happens over the next few years,” said Kerr, who is often called upon by high-power attorneys to assist in image-strategizing for their clients. “And don't forget – and I think this is unfortunate the way it is – but she's an aging actress and her heyday was when she was quite a bit younger. So that's a factor that would have to be considered.”LORI LOUGHLIN 'NERVOUS' AFTER JUDGE REFUSES TO DISMISS CHARGES IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS CASE: REPORTAsked if Loughlin’s YouTube star daughter Olivia will be able to land on her feet in the eyes of the public following the scandal? Kerr believes so though the task will take some massaging.“The public will be swayed by whoever gets the most press and the most positive press or the most credibility,” she explained. “So if she got a bad shake because it was really her mother who persuaded her to do this, people will probably forgive her, but it's going to take some rehabilitation [and] that's going to be doing some acts of charity and stepping up, admitting it and then walking away from it and trying to build something bigger and better.”CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP“It usually is a matter of time and it can be months or a couple of years or what have you before somebody starts to emerge more prominently and comes back,” added Kerr. “It depends on who they are and what they've done.”"

In the NASCAR Cup Series race Wednesday night, he clipped Chase Elliott late to cause a spin -- Elliott waited and extended his middle finger at Busch -- and finished second to Joe Gibbs teammate Denny Hamlin.Busch was satisfied with his run."" I had a good showing, put on a little bit of an exciting show there at the end,"" he said.Busch said wife Samantha reached out to Marissa to offer solace. The Busch family had similar heartache in the past.Briscoe appreciated the words of consolation from the Busches and all the friends in NASCAR he's heard from the past two days.Busch and Timmy Hill were in all three Darlington races. The two plan to run all four races at Charlotte, too.After the delay Tuesday because of rain, more storms delayed the planned noon start for another 4 1/2 hours.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPNASCAR's Cup Series had a successful return at Darlington with two races.Kevin Harvick earned his 50th Cup win when he took Sunday's race, the first for the series in 10 weeks while Hamlin won a rain-shortened race Wednesday night, the first time the series ran on that day since 1984."

"Massive, rotating disk galaxy from the early universe discovered",Astronomy,James Rogers,2020-05-21,"A massive, rotating disk galaxy from the early universe has been discovered by an international team of astronomers.Galaxy DLA0817g, dubbed the ""Wolfe Disk"" after the late astronomer Arthur M. Wolfe, was discovered using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile.

Xavier Prochaska, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, in the statement.The researchers note that most huge disk galaxies, like our own Milky Way, reach their large mass relatively late in the 13.8-billion-year history of the universe.BLACK HOLE, 1,000 LIGHT-YEARS FROM EARTH, DISCOVERED“While previous studies hinted at the existence of these early rotating gas-rich disk galaxies, thanks to ALMA we now have unambiguous evidence that they occur as early as 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang,” said lead author Marcel Neeleman of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany.NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and the National Science Foundation’s Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) were also used to study the Wolfe Disk.The galaxy was first discovered in 2017 by ALMA when it examined the light from a more distant quasar, or highly active supermassive black hole. ""The light from the quasar was absorbed as it passed through a massive reservoir of hydrogen gas surrounding the galaxy, which is how it revealed itself,"" the researchers explained, in the statement.

We will continue to pursue accountability for undermining the integrity of college admissions,” United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling said in a statement.CORONAVIRUS VACCINE DEVELOPMENT: WHERE DOES IT STAND?Loughlin and Giannulli previously pleaded not guilty to expanded charges of bribery brought against them in October along with 11 other parents swept up in the scandal. The duo has been accused of arranging a total collective payment of $500,000 to Singer to get their daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella, recruited to USC as athletes on the crew team, despite never having participated in the sport.CORONAVIRUS: 5 UNUSUAL WAYS PEOPLE REACTEDThe charge of conspiracy to commit federal program bribery carries a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. The couple was previously hit with charges of money laundering and conspiracy that carried a potential sentence of 40 years if convicted on all of them.Nearly two dozen parents have already pleaded guilty in the case, including former “Desperate Housewives” star Felicity Huffman. She served almost two weeks in prison after she admitted to paying $15,000 to have someone correct her daughter’s entrance exam answers.The decision for the famous couple to plead guilty is in stark contrast to their legal defense from mere weeks ago. They previously asked U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton to dismiss charges against them after they believed they’d found potentially exonerating evidence.In court documents previously obtained by Fox News, attorneys for the famous couple argued that the entire case should be thrown out after notes from Singer seemingly showed that agents had urged him to lie in order to implicate parents like Loughlin and Giannulli in committing a criminal act.The couple’s defense also alleged that the prosecution was withholding this evidence for fear it was exonerating to their clients. However, Variety reported at the time that in a new April 8 court filing, the prosecution denied both that it acted in bad faith and that the evidence is at all exonerating.TOP CORONAVIRUS SCAMS TO BE AWARE OF“In a sprawling, fast-moving prosecution, the failure to produce the notes earlier was simply a mistake,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven E. Frank wrote at the time. “The defendants have suffered no prejudice, and their suggestion that the notes somehow ‘exonerate’ them, or reveal that the evidence against them was fabricated, is demonstrably false.”In his notes, Singer wrote that investigators told him to lie to get parents to make incriminating statements over recorded phone calls. The agents instructed him to say he told the parents the payments were bribes, instead of donations, according to the notes made public in legal filings.“They continue to ask me to tell a fib and not restate what I told my clients as to where there money was going — to the program not the coach and that it was a donation and they want it to be a payment,” Singer wrote, according to court documents.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPGorton had called Singer’s claims in his notes “serious and disturbing.” However, he ultimately agreed with the prosecution’s assertion that it did not present ample grounds to dismiss the case. Therefore, he rejected the defense’s bid to toss the indictment earlier this month.The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Denny Hamlin wins rain-shortened Toyota 500 at Darlington Raceway,Nascar,,2020-05-21,"Denny Hamlin won NASCAR's first Wednesday race since 1984 when rain stopped the event with 20 laps remaining at Darlington Raceway.The Daytona 500 winner was out front but out of fresh tires and trying to hang on when he got unintended help from Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Kyle Busch. The reigning Cup champion caused Chase Elliott to crash eight laps earlier to bring out the caution.A furious Elliott waited for Busch on the apron of the track and flipped Busch the middle finger as he passed. As NASCAR cleaned the track, it started to rain and the cars were called to pit road under red-flag.It was an already active evening at “The Track Too Tough To Tame” as drivers were racing against the field and the weather. As the drivers sat in their cars waiting for NASCAR to pull the plug, a handful of Elliott's crew members sat on the pit wall staring down Busch.One of Busch's crew members sat between them on the wall and NASCAR eventually ordered everyone back over the wall. Eight minutes later, the race was called and Busch was greeted by Alan Gustafson, Elliott's crew chief and Busch's former crew chief when he drove for Hendrick Motorsports, for a conversation between two masked competitors.Busch immediately copped to the error.“There's no question I made a mistake and just misjudged the gap,” Busch said. “They’re upset, they’re mad. I’m not just going to fix and we’re going to go have ice cream tomorrow. They’re going to dwell on it and I’m sure there are repercussions of it I’m going to have down the road.”Meanwhile, a fox was scampering across the deserted track and Hamlin, wearing a mask that depicted his actual smile, was having a muted celebration in the rain.He walked to victory lane under a large black umbrella. It was a 1-2 finish for Joe Gibbs Racing and Toyota. Hamlin has won three times at Darlington and has two wins this season.“I got my happy face on. Made sure I brought it with me,"" Hamlin said of his mask. He said he also had masks made with a “sad face” but only brought the smiling masks to a track he counts among his favorite.Hamlin thought he was in good shape when he made his last pit stop but a caution by Clint Bowyer, who won the first two stages of the race, jumbled the strategy with 34 laps remaining.Hamlin had no choice but to stay out on the track, and his crew chief Chris Gabehart told him over the radio, “you ain't going to like it, but we're going to have to eat our vegetables here.”Hamlin, the leader because he didn't pit on the restart with 29 to go, only had to hold off traffic for one lap before the Busch and Elliott collision. The rain then came and Hamlin earned the trophy.“It’s a driver’s race track,” he said. “You can do different things to make (the car) handle. We got it right.”The race marked the first time in NASCAR history that the Cup Series had two points-paying races at the same track in one week.The start of NASCAR's second race back during the coronavirus pandemic was moved up an hour because of poor weather, but that was then delayed nearly 90 minutes because it rained most of the day.When the action finally began, the 310-mile affair was spirited from start to finish because drivers were unsure if they were racing to the halfway point — the mark a race becomes official — or the distance.NASCAR returned to action Sunday at Darlington after a 10 weeks off by using a a strict health protocol and limiting those in attendance to only the most essential for conducting a race.Health screenings were required to enter the track and each of the 40 cars were allowed just 16 team members.Fox Sports again broadcast the race primarily from a studio in Charlotte, North Carolina, with just one pit reporter at Darlington. For its prerace show, drivers used varying technology to make brief appearances while sitting alone in their motorhomes.Drivers had to travel to the track alone, pass through a health screening and then isolate before the race. They are required to wear face masks.NASCAR has an ambitious return plan of 20 races spanning its three national series between Sunday's return and June 21. Spectators are not expected to be permitted to any of the events in this span.Rain disrupted the schedule Tuesday night when the Xfinity Series was washed out. That race is now scheduled to be held Thursday afternoon.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"

"Titanic salvage firm gets approval for controversial plan to cut into wreck, retrieve telegraph machine",Digging History,James Rogers,2020-05-21,"A salvage firm has received approval from a judge in Virginia to remove the telegraph machine from the famous Titanic wreck that was used to send distress signals when the liner sank more than 100 years ago.Salvage company RMS Titanic Inc.’s plan to retrieve the Marconi wireless telegraph has sparked controversy, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration among those who have fiercely opposed the mission. NOAA argued in court documents that the telegraph is likely surrounded “by the mortal remains of more than 1,500 people,” and should be left alone.RMS Titanic Inc. submitted a 60-page plan to retrieve the telegraph, which is believed to still sit in a deckhouse near the doomed ocean liner’s grand staircase. The company said an unmanned submersible would slip through a skylight or cut the heavily corroded roof to retrieve the radio. A “suction dredge” would remove loose silt, while manipulator arms could cut electrical cords.DID THIS ICEBERG SINK THE TITANIC?Titanic hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship's time on April 14, 1912, and sank just over two hours later with the loss of more than 1,500 lives. The wreck, which is lying on seabed at a depth of 12,467 feet, is approximately 350 miles south of Newfoundland.EYOS Expeditions, which led an expedition to the wreck site last year, also voiced its concerns about RMS Titanic’s plans earlier this year.A spokesman for NOAA told Fox News that the agency is reviewing the court's decision and has no comment at this time. EYOS Expeditions also declined to comment on the court order when contacted by Fox News. ""We have no comment as this does not involve us or our expeditions in any way,"" a spokesman said.In a statement emailed to Fox News, RMS Titanic Inc. described the telegraph device as a tangible link to Titanic's past. “We remain dedicated to sharing the legacy of the Ship and her passengers with the public,"" said Bretton Hunchak, President of RMS Titanic, Inc., in the statement. ""Without the recovery, conservation and display of these artifacts, the ability to experience first-hand additional significant historic artifacts would be limited to only an exclusive group, those who have the privilege and economic means to travel to the wreck site.""The company also says that it is working to bring the history of Titanic and its artifacts to schools around the world. “It is important to RMS Titanic, Inc. that the recovery of the Marconi is part of educational outreach programs in schools,"" said Hunchak. ""We are diligently working with multiple school districts to bring both our data and expertise to students so they can be a part of history and follow along as we endeavor to make this complex recovery.""NEW TITANIC IMAGES SHOW THE WRECK’S 'SHOCKING' DETERIORATIONIn an order released Monday, U.S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith agreed that the telegraph is historically and culturally important and could soon be lost within the rapidly decaying wreck site.Smith wrote that recovering the telegraph “will contribute to the legacy left by the indelible loss of the Titanic, those who survived, and those who gave their lives in the sinking.""Smith is the maritime jurist who presides over Titanic salvage matters from a federal court in Norfolk. Her ruling modifies a previous judge’s order from the year 2000 that forbids cutting into the shipwreck or detaching any part of it.INCREDIBLE TITANIC TALE: SILVER FLASK WAS DAMAGED IN THE SHIP’S DEATH THROES, REUNITED WITH ITS OWNERThe order has been described as a big win for RMS Titanic Inc., the court-recognized salvor, or steward, of the Titanic’s artifacts. The firm recently emerged from bankruptcy and is under new ownership.Last year, an expedition to the Titanic led by EYOS Expeditions revealed the ill-fated liner’s deterioration on the North Atlantic seabed.Eerie footage of the dive obtained by the BBC showed the Titanic’s rusting bow and parts of the ship’s wrecked hull. Despite the wreck’s rapidly deteriorating state, glass can still be seen in some of the Titanic’s portholes.TITANIC CONTROVERSY: SUB USED IN UNDERWATER EXPEDITION HIT FAMOUS WRECK, SAY COURT DOCUMENTSMore than 100 years after the Titanic’s sinking, the disaster continues to be a source of fascination.

Auschwitz discovery: Secret items hidden by prisoners found at concentration camp site,Digging History,James Rogers,2020-05-21,"A number of items hidden by prisoners at Auschwitz have been recovered from a chimney at the site of the Nazi concentration camp in Poland.The objects were found in Block 17 of the former Main Camp at Auschwitz as part of the renovation work undertaken by Austria’s National Fund for the victims of Nazism. The restoration work is in preparation for a new Austrian exhibition.“A chimney flue was uncovered on the ground floor while measures were being undertaken to preserve original masonry,” the National Fund explained in a statement. “Hidden objects came to light beneath it, including knives, forks, hooks, scissors, pieces of leather, cobbler's tools and parts of shoes.”It is not yet clear why the items were hidden. “In the absence of an in-depth analysis by historians and conservators, it is still too early to discuss how they were used and the possible intentions of the prisoners – conceivable examples include making and repairing clothes, locksmithing or to prepare for an escape,” explained the National Fund. “It is also possible that the scissors and cutlery were used to barter with other prisoners.”HUNDREDS OF CHILLING ITEMS DISCOVERED AT NAZI MASSACRE SITESPrisoners with special manual skills were housed in the building where the items were found, according to the National Fund. “Survivor testimonies indicate that there were a number of workshops in the cellar where, for example, baskets were woven,” it said.The largest of the Nazi concentration camps and extermination centers used in the Holocaust, over 1.1. million men, women and children were killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau.Austria’s National Fund for the victims of Nazism was set up in 1995. The fund “renders payments to victims of National Socialism, in particular to those who had previously received little or no compensation; to those in need of special assistance or those whose personal circumstances warrant relief,” it explains, on its website.HOLOCAUST DISCOVERY: RITUAL BATHS UNCOVERED IN SYNAGOGUE COMPLEX DESTROYED BY NAZISDiscoveries such as the Auschwitz items offer a glimpse into the horrific events of World War II. Last year hundreds of chilling items were discovered at Nazi massacre sites in northwestern Germany. The finds were uncovered at three sites in the Arnsberg forest, where members of the Waffen-SS and German army massacred 208 Polish and Russian forced laborers in March 1945, just before the end of World War II.In 2017, experts uncovered two ritual baths in the remains of the Great Synagogue of Vilnius, in Lithuania, more than 70 years after its destruction during the Holocaust.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn a separate project in Lithuania, a tunnel used by Jewish prisoners to escape the Nazis was discovered.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers"

I think it’s important in life, particularly for astronauts, to be grateful for what we had the chance to do. I am very happy that I had these opportunities, so I am very happy for these guys.”STS-135, the last space shuttle mission, launched from Kennedy Space Center on July 8, 2011.

"Bulls championships with Doug Collins as head coach weren’t going to happen, former players say",NBA,Ryan Gaydos,2020-05-21,"Doug Collins failed to get an opportunity to lead Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls to an NBA championship and some former players believe it may have been a blessing in disguise for the former NBA superstar.Collins was out as head coach after losing in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1989. He was replaced with Phil Jackson, who would eventually help the Bulls win six championships.DENNIS RODMAN CALLS OUT FORMER BULLS TEAMMATES' COMPLAINTS ON PORTRAYAL IN 'THE LAST DANCE'Bill Cartwright and Ron Harper, two former Bulls players, believe that, while Collins was a great coach, he couldn’t have done the job Jackson did to take the Bulls to an NBA Finals victory. The two discussed Collins in a BetOnline video on Wednesday.“Probably not,” Cartwright said when asked whether the Bulls win a title with Collins. “One of the reasons why Doug was let go was because he was unable to incorporate Tex Winter, who was Jerry Krause’s first hire. Couple of interesting things happened. Once Phil was hired we incorporated Tex and the triangle. The other thing is we incorporated Al Vermiel, who was Jerry Krause’s second hire. I just think those two things are really integral and took us all the way with our game plan.”Harper agreed and added that Collins wanted Jordan to lead the league in scoring instead of building an offense in which everybody got involved.SPURS WOULD HAVE BEATEN MICHAEL JORDAN-LED BULLS IN HYPOTHETICAL 1999 NBA FINALS, EX-PLAYER SAYS“Jerry Krause made the move to hire Phil and Phil knew the only way they could win as a basketball team was to incorporate everybody,” Harper said. “The triangle offense allowed everybody to touch the basketball and play with the basketball.""“If you have one guy out there dominating the basketball and scoring the basketball, you ain’t going to win a lot of basketball games. You’re going to win a lot of games, but you ain’t going to be a championship team. Phil, the coaching staff, they allowed Phil to have more of a plan with MJ and say, ‘You’re going to score but we need the other guys to help the team. You’re going to score your points but we need you to get these guys to become better players in the roles they had.’ So without Phil and the coaching staff I don’t think they would have won a championship.”CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COMThe Jackson-coached Bulls won their first NBA title in 1991 as part of their first three-peat.

Scottie Pippen's portrayal in 'The Last Dance' an issue with former Bulls players,NBA,Ryan Gaydos,2020-05-21,"Several former Chicago Bulls players believe Scottie Pippen got the short end of the straw during “The Last Dance” documentary and feel he should have been portrayed better.Craig Hodges, Bill Cartwright and Horace Grant discussed Pippen’s portrayal in discussion with BetOnline on Wednesday. All three former players felt Pippen should have been treated more fairly and that Chicago may not have had some of its great success without Pippen.SCOTTIE PIPPEN IS 'BEYOND LIVID' ABOUT HOW MICHAEL JORDAN PORTRAYED HIM IN 'THE LAST DANCE'The players mentioned Pippen electing not to rehab an injury until the start of the 1997-98 season and how Pippen sat for the final seconds of a 1994 playoff game against the New York, which the documentary revealed was addressed in the locker room after the game.“It was straight-up bulls—t. It was straight-up bulls—t how they portrayed Scottie,” Grant said. “First off, being the No. 2 on that team and how he came out in terms of against Utah could barely walk, setting screens, getting knocked on the floor, the whole nine yards, and for them, that documentary, to call him…well, MJ called him selfish, that’s some BS. That’s straight-up BS.“If it wasn’t for Scottie Pippen there would be no six championships. I’m telling you right now guys. The first championship I think MJ got in foul trouble against the Lakers and who came to the rescue? No. 33. Scottie Pippen. Scottie Pippen. Yes, he made a mistake. We addressed that after the game. And then it was over with and we took the Knicks to seven games. My question is: How in the hell did that get on this documentary when MJ’s a-s wasn’t even on the team.”DENNIS RODMAN CALLS OUT FORMER BULLS TEAMMATES' COMPLAINTS ON PORTRAYAL IN 'THE LAST DANCE'Cartwright said that the 1993-94 season was when Pippen evolved as a player because he didn’t have Jordan and made a mistake in the infamous Knicks game.“It’s interesting that when the play when Pip did not come back in the game, that was Pip’s best year. He had evolved into a leadership role, played great,” Cartwright said. “To me, people make mistakes and then you move on from them. I think Scottie has a big heart. And when I first got to the Bulls he wasn’t a great shooter, skinny, extraordinarily talented, so everything he had he worked for. For me Pip was a great teammate and like I said it was one man’s show and that’s what they saw. But that’s not really reality.”Hodges was Pippen’s teammate for the final four years of his career, from 1989 to 1992. He said he feels like Michael Jordan would not have won anything without Pippen.“I’m still kind of upset about it because I know the type of brother that Scottie is. Scottie is the type of brother, I wasn’t part of the team when he didn’t stand up and come back out and play during that play, but I know that Scottie is the type of cat that will give his shirt for you, go on the ground for you and kick out the shot for you. I didn’t like how he was portrayed and I don’t understand the reasoning behind it and I’m still trying to figure that out,” Hodges said.PICTURE OF MICHAEL JORDAN'S ICONIC SHOT REVEALS LOTS OF HIDDEN GEMS, PHOTOGRAPHER SAYS“Without Scottie, MJ would not have won. It’s like all the brothers sitting here. It’s almost like MJ won in a vacuum and it wasn’t anything like that.

"Coronavirus may expand remote work across many industries, analysts say",Coronavirus,Frank Miles,2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.Tech giants were the first to send their employees home as the coronavirus pandemic spread to the U.S. Now they’re among the last to bring them back to the office. Some of their employees might never go back.Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Twitter are studying what their highly paid, highly valued employees want, using their own technology to make remote work easier and looking to hire new workers outside of big city hubs. It’s a potentially huge turnaround after years in which companies like Amazon and Google chased scarce tech talent by opening or expanding offices in hip urban locations such as San Francisco and New York.Such a shift might also amount to a repudiation of the notion that creative work demands corporate campuses reminiscent of college, with free food, ping pong tables and open office plans designed to encourage unplanned interactions.CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOWThe result could re-imagine not just Silicon Valley but other cities as the companies expand hiring in places like Atlanta, Dallas and Denver, where Facebook plans to open new “hubs” for its new, mostly remote hires.It’s too early to know whether remote work options will mean an exodus of highly-paid tech workers from San Francisco and Silicon Valley, where they’ve contributed to skyrocketing rents and housing prices. But Facebook’s employee survey suggests that at least some of its employees would leave the San Francisco Bay Area if given the option.For companies that have built their empires on letting people communicate with far-flung friends and colleagues, moving toward remote work is not too hard of a sell. But there are many challenges. Collaboration, spontaneity, face-to-face interactions that aren’t on a scheduled call — all look different when people are working alone from their homes.There are also some jobs — in Facebook’s case, the toughest content reviewing that deals with suicides, child abuse and other traumatizing material; sales; building, upgrading and maintaining data centers; lawyers who have to be in court and so on — that can’t be done remotely.Newer employees, especially recent college grads or those with little experience and lower performers might also fall into this group, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg during an employee town hall Thursday that was broadcast live on his Facebook page. At Facebook, the CEO said employees will have to meet certain criteria to be considered for permanent remote work. This includes a level of seniority, strong performance and, naturally, being part of a team that supports remote work.For now, workers at Facebook, Google, Twitter and elsewhere can work remotely through 2020.CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGEAt Microsoft, employees can work from home until October. But the company’s work-from-home flexibility has fit with the software giant’s broader effort to capitalize on what CEO Satya Nadella calls a shift to “remote everything.”“Every organization will increasingly need the ability at a moment’s notice to remote everything from manufacturing to sales, to customer support,” Nadella said this week at the company’s Build developer conference.The company’s chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, had already been working a lot from home, in part because he is based in Silicon Valley and most of the rest of the leadership team is in Redmond, Wash.“We are all on this accelerated timeline figuring out how to work from home.... It’s learning the culture and the rhythms of interacting with your colleagues by video conference and doing your work remotely,” he said, speaking not just of Microsoft but workplaces in general. “That is getting so much better so quickly that I don’t think I’m going to be commuting nearly as frequently as I was before.”The Associated Press contributed to this report."

"Intense fitness classes can lead to rapid spread of COVID-19, report shows",Coronavirus,Rachael Rettner | LiveScience,2020-05-21,"Fitness dance classes are yet another venue where the new coronavirus appears to easily spread, according to a new report.The report found that dozens of people in South Korea caught COVID-19 after participating in fitness dance classes at the beginning of the pandemic.The researchers traced the cluster back to a workshop that was held for fitness dance instructors in Cheonan, South Korea, on Feb. 15, according to the report, published May 15 in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The workshop involved four hours of intense training, the report said. Among the 27 fitness instructors who participated, eight later tested positive for COVID-19, although none had symptoms on the day of the workshop.Not knowing they had COVID-19, those instructors then went on to teach their own fitness dance classes.By March 9, the researchers had identified 112 COVID-19 cases tied to fitness dance classes at 12 different sports facilities in Cheonan.About half of the cases occurred due to direct transmission from instructors to students during classes, which lasted nearly an hour and met twice a week. The rest of the cases (not including the instructors themselves) occurred due to spread from the students to their family members or coworkers.The researchers noted that the classes involved many people engaging in high-intensity exercise in a small space — a pretty ideal environment for COVID-19 spread.""The moist, warm atmosphere in a sports facility coupled with turbulent air flow generated by intense physical exercise can cause more dense transmission of isolated droplets,"" the authors said.The number of people in a class also appeared to play a role in disease spread: Typical-size classes, with up to 22 participants, resulted in disease spread, while small classes with fewer than five people did not result in any spread of COVID-19, the report found.Interestingly, one of the infected instructors also taught yoga and pilates, but none of these students became infected. The authors hypothesized that the lower intensity of these activities did not result in the same level of transmission as the high-intensity fitness classes.Overall, ""because of the increased possibility of infection through droplets, vigorous exercise in closely confined spaces should be avoided during the current outbreak,"" the authors concluded.Originally published on Live Science."

The findings are the culmination of several research projects by the same team on human resilience, including experiments on the ability of the human face to take a punch and the human hands’ efficacy as melee weapons.“We found that fully furred samples were capable of absorbing more energy than plucked and sheared samples,” according to the jaw-dropping experiment conducted by biologists Ethan Beseris, Steven Naleway and David Carrier.Fortunately, no humans were slugged in the name of science. Instead, the team employed an epoxy composite skull covered in several styles of sheep skin — plucked, trimmed, and full-on mutton chops (so to speak).

Therefore, all pool-goers should maintain adequate hand hygiene, cover coughs and sneezes, adhere to social distancing guidelines, and wear cloth face-coverings, the CDC advises.GLOBAL CORONAVIRUS CASES SURPASS 5 MILLIONWhile pool visitors should wear face coverings, it's important to note that the CDC advised against wearing cloth face coverings in the water because they can cause breathing difficulties when wet.Swimmers might also hear regular announcements over the PA system and see posted signs advising safety around the virus.Public pools that choose to open this summer should disinfect high-touch surfaces — such as lounge chairs, pool noodles, and kickboards — on a daily basis, per the CDC.HOMEMADE CORONAVIRUS MASKS: TIPS TO WASH YOUR FACE COVERING PROPERLYPool-goers can also anticipate pool chairs to be spaced apart in an effort to comply with social-distancing measures.

Financial fallout of COVID-19 hits Montana ranch that helps female veterans fight PTSD,Fox News Flash,Emily DeCiccio,2020-05-21,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.Lisa Ledoux and her mother have been operating Serenity Ranch in Montana since May 2016, providing free equine therapy to female veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other traumas.The economic fallout of COVID-19, however, has taken a toll on Serenity Ranch and is forcing the horse rescue facility to roll back its critical equine therapy programs and sell nearly 40 acres of land.“This year, unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will be unable to do a female veteran program,” said Ledoux. “We’ll be taking care of the horses, and that's kind of what we've been focusing on more lately since the pandemic started, just because the donations that we were receiving have gone down significantly.”Ledoux explained to Fox News that it’s just her and her mom taking care of the ranch and the horses. She broke down the high operating costs and noted that a bale of hay, for example, is $120, and the horses go through one bale in about a day-and-a-half.""The hay cost alone is very pricey, not to mention maintenance of our land, making sure fencing is up to par so horses don't get out,” said Ledoux. “We have to trim our horses’ feet, which is not an easy task either ... and just to do that is about $2,000 to $3,000, so the cost of running the place adds up.”Ledoux and her mother depend on donations to run Serenity Ranch and offer free-of-charge equine therapy to at-risk women. Their dedication comes from their firsthand account of equine therapy when they both experienced loss. When Ledoux’s stepfather died suddenly of a heart attack, they learned how effective working with horses could be when coping with trauma.“The horses are truly healing and they helped us through some really rough times,” said Ledoux. “We wanted to share that, so we established the Serenity Ranch.”A six- to seven-day stay at the ranch includes resilience training with a licensed coach, lessons from a local veterinarian so the women can learn how to tackle first aid issues with the horses, and writing sessions. The women get paired with a horse and they ride that particular horse for the duration of the week.Air Force veteran Cari Simmons explained to Fox News how Serenity Ranch's program impacted her.""Not only was I able to bond with other veterans in magical place of true serenity, the owners and staff at the ranch offered me unconditional acceptance so I could find my voice and confidence again,"" said Simmons. ""On top of that, the herd of magical horses who live on the ranch touched my heart in ways that allowed me to love again — not only them but myself as well. I am so very grateful.""Ledoux and her mother have been rescuing diverse breeds of horses for about 15 years and currently have 41 horses at Serenity Ranch. The mother-daughter duo takes on horses that people may no longer want and also facilitate rescue operations. For example, two years ago, Ledoux and her mother assisted a rescue from a hoarding situation of 40 horses.“That situation was awful, the horses hadn't been cared for or they hadn't been fed, and they hadn't been watered,” said Ledoux. “So we took the 40 horses onto our property, and I am happy to say that most of them have either been homed or adopted.”Ledoux noted that the horses with traumatic pasts truly connect with the women who have suffered trauma themselves, and noted the healing properties of the human-horse connection.“When you're leading a horse, you have to be in the present, and if you're thinking about what you ate for breakfast or thinking about what you were gonna have for lunch or anything, the horses know and will act out,” explained Ledoux. “They might rear up, they might kick, so in order to handle a horse, your brain has to be in a state of complete presence, and you have to be in the moment.”For more on how Serenity Ranch is helping veterans watch the full interview with Serenity Ranch founder Lisa Ledoux above.Emily DeCiccio is a reporter and video producer for Fox News Digital Originals.

"Rep. Roger Marshall, M.D.: WHO desperately needs reform – here’s how to protect global health now",OPINION,"Rep. Roger Marshall, M.D.",2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.For the last 70 years, the U.S. and countries around the world have put their trust in the World Health Organization (WHO) to alert the global community of disease outbreaks and provide technical expertise in public health. In return, the WHO has – time and again – demonstrated its systemic organizational problems and lack of accountability.The COVID-19 pandemic is just one more example of the WHO’s willingness to let politics govern over their core responsibility as a global public health watchdog.As a physician, I’m especially concerned about the WHO’s failure to properly respond to these outbreaks. Nearly 100,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, and this international health organization must be held to strict medical and information sharing standards going forward.AVELLA AND DUGAN: GEORGIA VS. CORONAVIRUS — THESE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCEDecisions by the WHO guide and impact the abilities of medical providers to provide proper guidance and care for their patients.The director-general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom, made several disastrous mistakes in mitigating and preventing the COVID-19 outbreak. On Jan. 14, the Chinese government denied human-to-human transmission of the virus was occurring, and the WHO quickly endorsed their message. It’s shocking that the WHO made no attempt to independently verify the claims of an undemocratic government widely known for its iron muzzle on the media, the “Great Firewall” of Internet controls, and an unapologetic history of concealing the truth.Then again, this easy solidarity with China is no surprise when considering Tedros was largely backed by China when seeking the WHO’s top position. More notably, his home country is one of Africa’s leading partners for China’s “Belt and Road Initiative” and China remains their largest source of foreign investment.Politics, unfortunately, had much to do with the Tedros decision to state that the Chinese response to the outbreak was “transparent” and had his full confidence. As Tedros was helping the Chinese government, hospitals across Wuhan became overwhelmed by sick patients while Chinese officials silenced the medical community with one hand, and stockpiled personal protective equipment with the other.However, thanks to unwavering international pressure, Tedros declared the outbreak a public health emergency and changed course.It is time to reevaluate the organizational structure of the WHO to ensure future responses are based on science, not propaganda.It’s doubtful the WHO would have reacted differently without Tedros catering to China. This isn’t the organization’s first failure at responding to a disease outbreak. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic sparked heavy criticism of the WHO’s poor performance and prompted many external and internal investigations calling for reform. While some reform measures have been adopted, WHO continues to lack accountability, and without it, medical expertise and public health will always come second to politics and propaganda.Independent investigations of the COVID-19 outbreak will undoubtedly be written and recommendations for reform will be outlined. Minor technical changes will be adopted and the ones threatening political favor will be ignored. In order to ensure meaningful changes are actually made, countries need to abandon the carrot and grab the stick.The U.S. is the largest volunteer contributor to the WHO, and with these persistent problems, the Trump administration rightly decided to halt funding pending an investigation into its handling of the COVID-19 outbreak.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERAs the Trump administration continues to pry open political motivations driving the WHO, over 60 countries, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, as well as the European Union, have signed a resolution backing the investigation. That resolution was recently adopted unanimously during a virtual meeting of the World Health Assembly, despite repeated complaints from China.It is time to reevaluate the organizational structure of the WHO to ensure future responses are based on science, not propaganda.Participating countries should consider establishing a small select voting body of medical experts, similar to the structure of the United Nations Security Council, with the purpose of championing cooperation in solving global health issues. This body could oversee significant policy issues like outbreaks, major capital expenditures, and assess actions taken by other countries during public health emergencies.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAccountability comes with the power to make decisions that member states are then obligated to implement. This would be supplemented with international pressure.The U.S. — the largest single provider of humanitarian assistance, the largest contributor to the WHO, and global watchdog — must lead this fight to ensure the WHO fulfills its role in global health and pandemic response.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP.

Rep. Brian Mast: Memorial Day and my fallen friends show us how to thrive after coronavirus,OPINION,Rep. Brian Mast | Fox News,2020-05-21,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.The coronavirus pandemic has confronted our nation with many unique challenges. For the first time in our storied history, Americans were asked to not go to work, to not hustle and to not exhaust ourselves.Now, we are presented with an equal number of questions about how to move forward and re-open. How does America recover? How do we press forward? And how do we move on from the collapse of the routine that has always driven us on?I believe that Memorial Day can help provide the answer to these questions.MICHAEL LEVIN: AFTER CORONAVIRUS, HOW WILL YOU ANSWER THIS IMPORTANT QUESTION?Memorial Day gives us answers because we can reflect and seek spiritual guidance from the most selfless our country has ever known. We look to their grit. We ask ourselves what they would tell us to do and how would they ask us to revere the freedom they gave their last breath to provide.While they are no longer here to share what they learned in person, their stories leave us with lessons that are especially important in times where our country is challenged with adversity.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTEREach week when I fly into Washington, D.C., I see the beautiful white crosses and Stars of David of Arlington National Cemetery from above. When my young boys, Magnum and Maverick, are with me we tour the seemingly endless Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the larger-than-life steel statues of the Korean War Memorial, or the expansive World War II Memorial. In my opinion, there are none from whom we can learn more than these heroes who gave it all so that we may live free.Gracing the walls of the building that houses my office are the names of each fallen brother and sister from my war. Each day, as I pass through the entrance, I see the faces of those I knew, and each time my eye catches a heading for all lost in a given month and year my mind replays conversations had with so many fallen friends.The etching of their names reminds us of their commitment to the fight and the way nothing would ever stop them.Every time, I wonder if we are worthy of their sacrifice. Just as each soldier strives to prove themselves each day of service, I believe my fallen friends would want each civilian to strive to prove themselves each day of free life. In that, I believe, lies the answer to how our country recovers from this crisis.So, this Memorial Day, I am reflecting on the sacrifice of my friends — that I served with, took fire with, climbed mountains in Afghanistan with, disarmed bombs with and took it to America’s enemies with — and the lessons we can learn from them:Americans are never victims. If we wake up under the flag they charged into battle with then we wake up getting to decide that today will be a better day than yesterday and that this week will be better than last week.I believe Staff Sgt. Eric Trueblood (KIA 03/10/2011) would remind us that we are not measured by what we do when something is a walk in the park. Rather, we get measured when we face something that seems impossible.I believe Staff Sgt. David Day (KIA 04/24/2011) would tell us that the tougher the times, the tougher the people get built.Sgt. Justin Allen (KIA 07/18/2010) was never one to feel sorry for himself, so I believe he would take on the challenge with everything he’s got — not once complaining.Sgt. Anibal Santiago (KIA 07/18/2010) would probably challenge everybody — in language that isn’t fit to print — to have the courage to get out and live their lives.I believe Senior Chief Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician Craig Vickers (KIA 08/06/2011) would remind us—in excruciating detail—that, no matter what we do, every minute still has 60 seconds, each hour still has 60 minutes and each day is still going to take 24 of those. We shouldn’t let time pass us by trying to evade life’s challenges.I believe Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician Second Class Petty Officer Tyler Trahan (KIA 04/01/2009) would keep it simple: keep going no matter what, he might say.I believe Capt. Kyle Comfort (KIA 05/08/2010) would remind us that even knowing every possible detail about the coronavirus that there is to know, there is still going to be risk.I believe Doc Jonathan Peney (KIA 06/01/2010) would tell us that not even training to be safe is safe.I believe Sgt. Tanner Higgins (KIA 04/14/2012) would tell us not to waste a moment of this precious life that we have the privilege to live.I believe Sgt. Andrew Nicol (KIA 08/08/2010) would probably say that he didn’t live in tents, cargo ship containers, mud huts and swamps so the people he fought for can curl up and hide.Finally, I believe Sgt. 1st Class Lance Vogeler (KIA 10/01/2010) — one of my closest friends and who I would undoubtedly turn to for advice if he were still here — would share with me a couple lessons. Seek the positive in the negative, he would say. Commitment to life is not about the quantity of minutes we get but about the way we spend the minutes we have and how we effect those in our path.A massive quantity of his minutes were spent in combat fighting for us. He was killed during his 12th deployment, just days after I was taken off the battlefield by an improvised explosive device.Each Memorial Day I am given a renewed commitment to honor his sacrifice and the sacrifice of all those who were laid to rest beneath our beautiful flag of 50 stars and 13 red and white stripes. This Memorial Day, they all remind me that we are not made of glass and we don’t just break when we fall.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPI hope our nation can learn from them. We have been challenged by COVID-19, but Americans are never victims. If we wake up under the flag they charged into battle with then we wake up getting to decide that today will be a better day than yesterday and that this week will be better than last week. If we do not actively work to make it that way then we squander the life and freedom they gave everything to defend.So, for those honored by the slow hum of Taps, I pray that this Memorial Day the crack of their 21-gun salute can be so jarring that it wakes up the world.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP.

"Over 4,300 virus patients sent to NY nursing homes, AP counts",New York,"Bernard Condon, _Jennifer Peltz, _Jim Mustian | Associated Press",2020-05-21,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.More than 4,300 recovering coronavirus patients were sent to New York’s already vulnerable nursing homes under a controversial state directive that was ultimately scrapped amid criticisms it was accelerating the nation’s deadliest outbreaks, according to a count by The Associated Press.AP compiled its own tally to find out how many COVID-19 patients were discharged from hospitals to nursing homes under the March 25 directive after New York’s Health Department declined to release its internal survey conducted two weeks ago. It says it is still verifying data that was incomplete.Whatever the full number, nursing home administrators, residents’ advocates and relatives say it has added up to a big and indefensible problem for facilities that even Gov. Andrew Cuomo — the main proponent of the policy — called “the optimum feeding ground for this virus.”Cuomo downplays calls for federal probe into nursing home coronavirus deaths: 'Ask President Trump'“It was the single dumbest decision anyone could make if they wanted to kill people,” Daniel Arbeeny said of the directive, which prompted him to pull his 88-year-old father out of a Brooklyn nursing home where more than 50 people have died. His father later died of COVID-19 at home.“This isn’t rocket science,” Arbeeny said. “We knew the most vulnerable -- the elderly and compromised -- are in nursing homes and rehab centers.”Told of the AP’s tally, the Health Department said late Thursday it “can’t comment on data we haven’t had a chance to review, particularly while we’re still validating our own comprehensive survey of nursing homes admission and re-admission data in the middle of responding to this global pandemic.”Cuomo, a Democrat, on May 10 reversed the directive, which had been intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged. But he continued to defend it this week, saying he didn’t believe it contributed to the more than 5,800 nursing and adult care facility deaths in New York — more than in any other state — and that homes should have spoken up if it was a problem.“Any nursing home could just say, ‘I can’t handle a COVID person in my facility,’” he said, although the March 25 order didn’t specify how homes could refuse, saying that ”no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the (nursing home) solely based” on confirmed or suspected COVID-19.Over a month later, on April 29, the Health Department clarified that homes should not take any new residents if they were unable to meet their needs, including a checklist of standards for coronavirus care and prevention.In the meantime, some nursing homes felt obligated and overwhelmed.Gurwin Jewish, a 460-bed home on Long Island, seemed well-prepared for the coronavirus in early March, with movable walls to seal off hallways for the infected. But after the state order, a trickle of recovering COVID-19 patients from local hospitals turned into a flood of 58 people.More walls were put up, but other residents nonetheless began falling sick and dying. In the end, 47 Gurwin residents died of confirmed or suspected COVID-19.The state order “put staff and residents at great risk,” CEO Stuart Almer said. “We can’t draw a straight line from bringing in someone positive to someone catching the disease, but we’re talking about elderly, fragile and vulnerable residents.”The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, known as AMDA, had warned from the beginning that Cuomo’s order admitting infected patients posed a “clear and present danger” to nursing home residents. Now, Jeffrey N. Nichols, who serves on the executive committee of the group, said “the effect of that order was to contribute to 5,000 deaths.”Nationally, over 35,500 people have died from coronavirus outbreaks at nursing homes and long-term care facilities, about a third of the overall death toll, according to the AP’s running tally.Cuomo has deflected criticism over the nursing home directive by saying it stemmed from Trump administration guidance. Still, few states went as far as New York and neighboring New Jersey, which has the second-most care home deaths, in discharging hospitalized coronavirus patients to nursing homes. California followed suit but loosened its requirement following intense criticism.Some states went in the opposite direction. Louisiana barred hospitals for 30 days from sending coronavirus patients to nursing homes with some exceptions. And while Louisiana reported about 1,000 coronavirus-related nursing home deaths, far fewer than New York, that was 40% of Louisiana’s statewide death toll, a higher proportion than in New York.New York’s Health Department told the AP May 8 it was not tracking how many recovering COVID-19 patients were taken into nursing homes under the order. But it was at that very moment surveying administrators of the state’s over 1,150 nursing homes and long-term care facilities on just that question.Those survey results have yet to be released. But regardless, the Health Department said, the survey had no bearing on Cuomo’s announcement May 10 that “we’re just not going to send a person who is positive to a nursing home after a hospital visit.”Cuomo said such patients would be accommodated elsewhere, such as sites originally set up as temporary hospitals.To some, the governor’s reversal came too late.CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE“It infected a great number of people in nursing homes who had no business getting infected, including short-term residents who were there for rehabilitation after surgeries,” said John Dalli, a New York attorney who specializes in nursing home cases.To be sure, incoming residents weren’t the only possible source of infection. Some homes believe a bigger contribution came from staffers and residents unaware they had the virus. And some say they would have taken on COVID-19 patients regardless of the state’s order.“There were nursing homes that realized that there was a void,” said Sarah Colomello, a spokeswoman for Thompson House in Rhinebeck. The 100-bed facility set up an isolated unit where affiliated hospitals nearby have sent at least 21 patients. It has reported no deaths.Cuomo administration officials say the original directive came when the governor feared the hospital system would be overwhelmed and was focused on creating as much hospital space as possible.That was welcomed by one of the many hospital systems and nursing homes surveyed for AP’s count. Northwell Health said three of its medical centers were so overtaxed at one point they had to put some ICU patients in hallways. To relieve pressure, the company eventually sent more than 1,700 COVID-19 patients to nursing homes.“Suffice it say, our hospitals were under stress,” spokesman Terence Lynam said."

Dems make big push to aid illegal immigrants amid coronavirus crisis,Illegal Immigrants,Adam Shaw,2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.Congressional Democrats and state governments are pushing a range of ways to assist illegal immigrants in their response to the coronavirus crisis, calling for the release of those in detention and lobbying to make them eligible for over a thousand dollars each in stimulus payments.President Trump, for his part, has responded to the crisis by cracking down on both illegal and legal immigration — slapping travel bans on China, Iran and the European Union and limiting entry on land borders to the north and south, while border officials are immediately returning illegal immigrants and asylum seekers to their home countries.HOUSE DEMOCRATS' CORONAVIRUS PACKAGE INCLUDES 'AMNESTY' FOR SOME ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, CRITICS SAYDemocrats, however, are taking the opposite approach. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., have introduced a bill that would release immigrants in detention into the country, and halt any immigration enforcement against anyone not deemed a “significant” threat to public safety.“We have an obligation to do everything we can to prevent the spread of this deadly disease, and that means moving people out of detention centers when they do not pose a public safety risk,” Booker said in a statement. “This is really a matter of life and death: it’s time that we act quickly and decisively to save as many lives as possible, and that means ending the unnecessary detention of immigrants during this public health crisis.”Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Democrats are demanding that the next round of stimulus checks include illegal immigrants by modifying a requirement that recipients have a Social Security number to receive one.DRUG CARTELS AT THE BORDER TRYING TO 'EXPLOIT' CORONAVIRUS CRISIS, CBP CHIEF SAYSA $3 trillion bill passed by the Democratic-controlled House last week would allow the $1,200 stimulus checks to go to those who also pay income taxes via an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) — which is used by people who are ineligible for a Social Security number, including illegal immigrants.As partial justification, Democrats have pointed to so-called mixed families, in which there are American citizens or legal permanent residents, as well as illegal immigrants, in one family. They file using an ITIN and so far have not been eligible for aid.“The Supreme Court ruled that children, undocumented children should have a right to education in our country. Why not then should citizens’ children, children in taxpayers’ families, not have the opportunity to the checks that they need?” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on a press call this month.But it’s an idea that has drawn strong criticism, even mockery, from Republicans who believe that aid should be reserved only to citizens and those here legally.“Can you believe it? We forgot to have the Treasury Department send money to people here illegally. My goodness. What an oversight,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor last week.The bill also included protections for “essential critical infrastructure workers” that would allow some illegal immigrants employed as such to be placed into “a period of deferred action” and be authorized to work if they meet certain conditions.It also grants protections to those employers who hire illegal immigrants, stating that “the hiring, employment or continued employment” of the defined group of illegal immigrants is not in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act.The move was flagged by Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli as a push by Democrats to grant ""amnesty"" to illegal immigrants and protection to those who employ them.“Is it really a good idea to not only grant an amnesty to illegal aliens but to absolve employers who have been breaking the law in the last few months?” he tweeted. “I don't think so!”SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL CALLS FOR $100 MILLION 'RELIEF FUND' FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTSMeanwhile, some state governments have been seeking to make sure illegal immigrants receive money and argue they should have been included in the last round of stimulus.The Seattle City Council is calling on Washington state to create a $100 million “relief fund” for illegal immigrants who did not qualify for the federal stimulus checks issued last month.The city’s council passed a resolution Monday asking Gov. Jay Inslee to create a “Washington Worker Relief Fund” to provide “economic assistance to undocumented Washingtonians during the COVID-19 pandemic.”Meanwhile in California, the state has opened up about $75 million for a fund to help roughly 150,000 illegal immigrants in the state. It gives them access to a coronavirus relief program that will pay $500 per person and up to $1,000 per household.The developments come as Democrats continue to shift left on immigration issues to the backdrop of the presidential race, drawing contrasts with Republicans who, along with the Trump administration, have advocated even tougher policies.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPDemocrats have opposed a host of Trump’s border security measures, including the wall at the southern border and the “Remain-in-Mexico” policy, while a number of top Democrats and presidential contenders have backed calls to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and to give health care and other social services to illegal immigrants.Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, meanwhile, has been on record calling for health care for illegal immigrants, as well as a 100-day moratorium on deportations if he wins the election in November."

It also says Issa's campaign costs would increase and it would force him to “reevaluate his electoral strategy,” Politico and Court House News reported.Issa “registered to run for office based under the electoral system established by the California Legislature,” the complaint says. “Now, he must develop a new strategy.”President Trump has claimed without evidence that voting by mail leads to voter fraud even though he voted via absentee ballot in Florida this year. “You get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody’s living room, signing ballots all over the place,” he said last month, according to The New York Times.Several other states, including Washington, Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon and Utah already vote by mail.NEWSOM ORDER SENDING MAIL-IN BALLOTS TO ALL CALIFORNIA VOTERS SPARKS CONCERNSNevada and Michigan are among several states planning to increase mail-in voting for the November election. Trump has threatened to cut the states' funding.California Secretary of State Alex Padilla called the lawsuit “immoral” and “un-American,"" according to Politico.“Exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic to justify voter suppression is despicable, even for Judicial Watch’s pathetically low standards,"" he said in a statement.He added that it threatened the “health of every Californian.”CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGEIssa was narrowly re-elected to California’s 49th district in North County San Diego and southern Orange County in 2016 and decided to retire in 2019.

It showed the president wearing a mask that included the presidential seal.""I had one on before,” Trump told reporters during the visit. “I wore one on in this back area.

I had goggles and a mask right back there.”TRUMP BRINGS MASK TO FORD, SAYS HE DOESN'T 'WANT TO GIVE THE PRESS THE PLEASURE OF SEEING' HIM WEARING ITHe added it wasn’t necessary to wear a mask around reporters and Ford representatives in the front of the plant because “Everybody's been tested.”Nessel told CNN the state would be speaking to Ford about allowing the president to go without a mask for the public portion of the tour in what she said was a violation of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive order requiring masks in enclosed public spaces.""They knew exactly what the order was and if they permitted anyone, even the president of the United States, to defy that order, I think it has serious health consequences potentially to their workers,” Nessel told CNN.She also said she was ""ashamed"" to have him as the president and she hoped Michigan voters ""will remember this when November comes, that he didn't care enough about their safety, he didn't care about their welfare, he didn't respect them enough just to engage in the very simple task, the painless task, the easy task of wearing a mask when he was provided one.""Trump suggested in another tweet that Ford might leave Michigan if it's held accountable for his actions.“Do nothing A.G. of the Great State of Michigan, Dana Nessel, should not be taking her anger and stupidity out on Ford Motor - they might get upset with you and leave the state, like so many other companies have - until I came along and brought business back to Michigan.

He wore a mask during a private viewing of three Ford GTs from over the years. The president later removed the mask for the remainder of the visit.” Bill Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford, has been the company’s executive chairman.Nessel later responded to Trump on Twitter, defending the state's auto industry.""Hi!

'Terror-related' shooting at NAS Corpus Christi prompts search for possible 2nd suspect,Manhunt,Dom Calicchio,2020-05-22,"A manhunt was underway in Texas for a possible second suspect after a Thursday shooting at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas that was “terror-related.”“We may have a potential second related person of interest at large in the community,” Leah Greeves, an FBI supervisory senior resident, told reporters, according to KRIS-TV of Corpus Christi.In a series of Twitter messages late Thursday, the FBI’s Houston office called on the public to share any information they may have about the NAS Corpus Christi incident.NAVAL AIR STATION CORPUS CHRISTI SHOOTING INVESTIGATED AS 'TERRORISM-RELATED,' FBI REPORTS“We are not ruling out any possible motives and continue to investigate all leads,” the FBI said in a post. “When we are able to release additional information, we will do so.”A gunman described as an “Arab male” and later identified by The Associated Press as Adam Alsahli of Corpus Christi was killed in a gunbattle with law enforcement at the station, located along the Gulf of Mexico, about 229 miles southwest of Houston.Authorities say the suspect tried to speed his vehicle through a security gate at the naval facility around 6:15 a.m. Thursday but was stopped by a guard who managed to put up a barrier in time to block the driver’s access.A female security officer was shot in the chest during an exchange of gunfire with the suspect, but she was wearing body armor and survived with only minor injuries, KRIS reported.Other security personnel soon arrived and fatally shot the suspect, the AP reported.Following that gunbattle, local police SWAT officers and FBI agents surrounded a home in Corpus Christi. A public records search by KRIS revealed the location to be Alsahli’s last known home address.But authorities would not confirm whether the operation was related to the incident at NAS Corpus Christi, the Caller Times of Corpus Christi reported.After the shooting, the naval air station was on lockdown for about five hours as authorities conducted their investigation.At a news conference, Greeves declared the incident “terror-related,” but provided no details on how investigators reached that conclusion.“We are working diligently with our state, local and federal partners on this investigation, which is fluid and evolving,” Greeves said.Attorney General William Barr has been briefed on the matter, a Justice Department spokesman told the AP.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPA similar lockdown occurred at NAS Corpus Christi last December after a suspect with a stolen firearm rammed a truck into a barricade there. The suspect later pleaded guilty to destruction of U.S. government property.Thursday’s incident also follows a Dec. 6 shooting at NAS Pensacola in Florida that left three U.S. sailors dead and eight other people wounded. The suspect in that case, who had been in contact with al-Qaeda operatives, was killed by a sheriff’s deputy.The Associated Press contributed to this story."

Teen left orphaned after murder-suicide earns $120G college scholarship through golf caddying,Proud American,Michael Ruiz,2020-05-22,"An Ohio teen who was left orphaned after a murder-suicide eight years ago has earned herself a full college scholarship to attend The Ohio State University through hard work in the classroom -- and as a caddy on the golf course.Caroline Jarrell was 10 years old and watching the Disney Channel when she heard four gunshots ring out into the night outside her father’s home.It was 8:04 p.m. on Jan. 10, 2012 -- a time she said has always stuck in her mind.Her parents were divorced. And her mother had arrived to pick up the children from a stay with their father, she told Fox News.Caroline was the first of her siblings to venture out after the noise. She found their mother’s body in the driveway, in her car with the family dog. Her father was dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound nearby.“I didn’t know what was going on,” she said Thursday. “I just knew that something bad had happened.”She remembers seeing blood, trying to talk to her mom, and a neighbor calling 911. Much of the rest of the night condensed into a blur.“It was just chaotic for everyone,” she said.Her grandparents, Dennis and Linda Pawlecki, as well as her mother’s brother Michael Pawlecki, drove over an hour that night to be with the children.“They were really helpful that night,” Jarrell said. “They helped calm me down, even though they were going through everything.”The Jarrell children stayed in their mother’s house the rest of that school year, with frequent visits from the Pawleckis. Then they moved in with their grandparents in Toledo, Ohio.Next semester, Jarrell is headed to The Ohio State University on a full ride thanks to the Evans Scholars Foundation, named for Charles “Chick” Evans Jr., a famed amateur golfer who set up the program with the Western Golf Association in 1930.Nick, the oldest of the Jarrell children, had already been caddying before they came to Ohio, at his mother’s urging. It was in an effort to earn that same scholarship.In Toledo, one of the first things he did was find a new caddying job at the famed Inverness Club, Caroline said. He eventually received the Evans Scholarship and went to The Ohio State University. Now he’s an English teacher in Cincinnati.Ellyn Jarrell, the middle child, earned herself her own Evans Scholarship -- and she’s still attending the University of Notre Dame, where their mother went to college.Following in the footsteps of her older siblings, Caroline started caddying at Inverness in the summer after eighth grade. She said it’s the only job she’s ever had.Now, she’s also achieved the Evans Scholarship.Working at Inverness, she met her future Ohio State roommate, Kelcy -- who is yet another Evans recipient.The Evans Scholarship covers full tuition and housing costs for “high-achieving caddies with limited financial means,” according to the foundation. That amounts to an estimated $120,000 per recipient. The Evans Scholars Program says it has paid out $410 million in scholarships overall.The scholarships receive financial support from tens of thousands of Par Club donors, as well as the WGA’s BMW Championship, which is a PGA Tour FedEx Cup playoff event.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPRecipients show good grades, financial need, “outstanding character” and a strong caddie record.At Ohio State, Caroline said she will study social work -- a career path she chose because of the social worker who helped her keep it together when she dealt her parents’ divorce as a child.“She was the first person who, besides my mom and my siblings, who just made me feel heard,” Jarrell said Thursday. “I just wanted to be that person for someone else, to help them feel like they’re not alone.”"

RNC Chair McDaniel: Democrats and voter fraud in Nevada — here's how it will impact you,OPINION,Ronna McDaniel,2020-05-22,"Democrats say they want more “inclusive” voting practices. They fail to mention just how inclusive their plans are: sending ballots to dead voters.Nevada is a case study of the lengths Democrats will go to secure a voting edge.First Marc Elias and Perkins Coie sued the state on behalf of Democrat groups, demanding election officials break laws against ballot harvesting, ignore signature verification requirements and send ballots to inactive voters the state believes moved away. They demanded more in-person voting locations while arguing voting in person was too dangerous for the June 9 mail-in vote primary.VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: CORONAVIRUS DEEPENS DIVISIONS — EXCEPT MAYBE THIS ONE BIT OF COMMON GROUNDThe message was sent, and Democrats in Clark County got in line. A new voting plan was reached “shrouded in mystery,” according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Officials would now increase the number of in-person voting locations in the Democrat-heavy region, mail ballots to all “voters” and allow “field registrars,” commonly known as ballot harvesters, to pick them up. All at the expense of taxpayers of $323,000, and the rule of law.The result has made Clark County look more like Tammany Hall. What is unfolding should concern every American.Weeks before the election, live ballots are piling up at apartment complexes. Others are found in the trash. The Review-Journal reported one postal worker has already found thousands of ballots that are “no good,” just “sitting in crates with no additional safeguards.” Jenny Trobiani, who has worked for the U.S. Postal Service for over three decades, said the ballots were for residents who “had all moved or died.” She even received one in the mail for her deceased mother.Dozens of ballots are being found pinned to community bulletin boards. “From Friday to Monday, I could have voted 20 times,” said one resident of an apartment complex in Las Vegas. “That’s what’s so concerning about all this.”Who is to stop a Democrat “field registrar” from picking them up, signing them and dropping them off? That sounds outrageous. But it is what Democrat groups are seeking in their lawsuit.Trained poll officials would no longer be able to throw out fraudulent ballots that do not match their signature on file. Instead, the lawsuit would prohibit what it calls the “dubious art of signature matching” and circumvent Nevada’s ballot harvesting ban. Signature matching is so “dubious” it has been required for every new voter registration in Nevada and used to verify every voter who shows up at the polls for years.This is not unique to Nevada. Democrats are attacking the integrity of our elections across the country and circling the wagons.Democrats are welcoming voter fraud in Nevada. And they are not even hiding it.The Elias lawsuit is explicit. It states the statewide ban on ballot harvesting “hamstrings” the ability of Democrat groups, including the Democratic National Committee, the Nevada State Democratic Party, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Priorities USA, to “assist voters in making the transition to vote by mail.”Democrats are happy to “assist,” as long as you vote Democrat.This is not unique to Nevada. Democrats are attacking the integrity of our elections across the country and circling the wagons.From Planned Parenthood to the Center for American Progress, left-wing activist groups are pushing the same false talking points that while we flatten the curve we must upend our elections. Voting must be more “inclusive” (by adopting liberal policies).Nancy Pelosi’s $3 trillion bill would launch a federal takeover of our elections, all in line with Elias’ lawsuits in 29 states. Their mission is to nationalize ballot harvesting, gut signature verification and voter ID laws and send millions of ballots to voters who have died or moved away, before November.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThat's why the Republican National Committee and Trump campaign have launched our Protect the Vote effort, a digital platform which spotlights our efforts to protect against the Democrats' assault on our elections as they push for sweeping changes, including vote-by-mail and more ballot harvesting amid the coronavirus pandemicThe opportunity for fraud with these Democrat proposals is enormous. There are over 200,000 inactive voters in Clark County alone. Inactive voters are given the opportunity to update their registrations and can still request a ballot in the upcoming election. Individuals are only deemed inactive after the state receives evidence from the Postal Service that they have moved.“Knowingly mailing a ballot to a wrong address is bad enough,” a Review-Journal editorial recently argued. “Combining that with the elimination of signature verification is an open invitation to shenanigans and makes absolutely no sense.”CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThat’s why this week I sent a letter to Nevada Attorney General Aaron D. Ford requesting an investigation into Clark County’s backroom deal, and potential violations of state election and open meeting laws.

Rep. Mike Gallagher: Is Congress nonessential? It's acting that way — but here's how we can fix that,OPINION,Mike Gallagher | Fox News,2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.The coronavirus crisis has forced all Americans to ask the question: what are the essential and non-essential things in our lives?Amid this debate, as Americans struggle to survive the shutdown and as our country struggles to avoid a prolonged recession, it is odd that Congress, through its actions, would openly declare itself nonessential. Congress has, after all, not congressed in any meaningful sense for over two months.During this time the largest spending bill in American history passed without amendments or a recorded vote. Last week Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., passed a rule allowing Congress to stay out of session until mid-July and a proxy voting proposal that would undo centuries of precedent and allow the speaker to pass legislation with less than 25 out of 435 members present.AVELLA AND DUGAN: GEORGIA VS. CORONAVIRUS — THESE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCEIn other words, approximately 5 percent of the members of Congress are essential and the rest of us are nonessential.These developments should not come as a surprise. They are essentially the culmination of decades of dereliction of constitutional duty by Congress. We have gone from the Framers fearing that the legislature would necessarily predominate and suck everything into its impetuous vortex to the current situation where Congress has decided, like a character in the film ""Office Space,"" that it is not going to quit, it is just going to stop going to work.What little power remains in the increasingly powerless institution is in the hands of an increasingly small number of people at the top of the legislative hierarchy. As I wrote two years ago reflecting on my first term in Congress: “I have come to believe that the problem (with Congress) is not the people. The problem is a defective process and a power structure that, whichever party is in charge, funnels all power to leadership and stifles debate and initiative within the ranks…“Leadership determines which bills come to the floor for a vote, leadership chooses loyal committee chairs so as to ensure that bills opposed by special interests will be killed in committee, and in the event that problematic amendments do make it to the House floor, the Rules Committee — an organ of the speaker — kills them off. The legislation that does pass tends to come in last-second omnibus bills that legislators have no chance to read, let alone debate and amend.”Two years later, the problem has gotten even worse. House Democratic leadership no longer need to rely on such subtle tactics to stifle debate and force rank-and-file members to cast up or down votes on multi-trillion dollar legislative packages: they now can simply keep us outside of Washington, D.C., and call a few of us back whenever the speaker needs their votes.How do we fix Congress? A good start would be to end the vacation and reconvene in person,President Obama said last weekend, “This pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge don’t know what they’re doing. A lot of them aren’t even pretending to be in charge.” I assume he was talking about Congress under Pelosi’s leadership. If so, I have to say what I don’t often say: I agree with President Obama.I know some conservatives might be tempted to think Congress’ inability to pass laws is a net positive. Yet the opposite is true. A feckless Congress further empowers unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats in the executive branch and activist judges in the judicial branch. A weak Congress passing complex, unreadable, 1,000-page bills written by a small group of staffers empowers special interests and fortifies the status quo against meaningful reform.A functional Congress is, in other words, essential. It is essential now more than ever.At a time when we are rapidly spending trillions of dollars that we do not have to combat coronavirus, Congress has to do oversight to ensure this money is having a positive impact.As we ramp up domestic manufacturing of PPE, it will require legislation passed by Congress to strengthen our medical supply chains and thereby wean America off of our dangerous dependency on cheap Chinese goods.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERAs we confront relentless Chinese Communist Party propaganda, Congress must come together and figure out a foundation for winning this New Cold War.How do we fix Congress? A good start would be to end the vacation and reconvene in person, for at least two weeks, so that we can start to do our committee work, which cannot be done by proxy. This should in turn lead to an enduring change in the congressional schedule, where we end this foolish practice of flying in and out of town each week for meaningless votes.While we are at it, Democrats should join the newly launched China Task Force so Congress can reassert its role U.S. foreign policy and send a strong signal of support to our friends in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang suffering from coercion and oppression by the Chinese Communist Party.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt would also be a good idea to drain the pesky swamp that seems to just get swampier. Eventually this means we will need a complete overhaul and simplification of the budget committee and appropriations process. But for now, let’s start small with a simple prohibition on former members of Congress lobbying on behalf of foreign entities.As we emerge from the coronavirus crisis, Congress must reclaim its rightful constitutional authority. Nothing could be more essential.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP. MIKE GALLAGHER"
Andrew McCarthy: Flynn judge must explain his astounding and offensive refusal to dismiss charges,OPINION,Andrew McCarthy,2020-05-22,"Is U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan’s collusion cameo nearing its end?On Thursday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, on its own motion, ordered Judge Sullivan to respond within 10 days to the petition for a writ of mandamus filed by former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.Earlier this week, Flynn’s counsel, Sidney Powell, filed the petition for that extraordinary writ, asking the appellate court to instruct Sullivan to grant the Justice Department’s motion to dismiss the case against Flynn.FEDERAL APPEALS COURT ORDERS JUDGE IN FLYNN CASE TO RESPOND TO MOTION TO DISMISS CHARGESCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERThat was after Judge Sullivan not only declined to grant the prosecution’s motion, but (a) invited non-parties to intervene in the case by filing amicus briefs (transparently, to make arguments that he somehow has authority to deny DOJ’s motion); and (b) appointed one amicus, former federal judge John Gleeson, as a quasi-prosecutor to make arguments that prosecutors are declining to make in favor of entering a judgment of conviction and sentencing Flynn.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAs I noted Wednesday, Sullivan’s encouragement of amicus briefs, which are not authorized in criminal cases, flies in the face of Sullivan’s own very firm orders previously declining to permit amicus briefs in Flynn’s case – some two dozen times by Powell’s count.The appointment of Gleeson is equally astonishing and offensive to the principle of courts as impartial arbiters.CLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEWCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY"

Lori Loughlin’s career and image could be ‘tainted’ after guilty plea in college admissions scandal: expert,Exclusive,Julius Young,2020-05-22,"Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, have agreed to plead guilty in the college admissions scandal case that loomed over them for more than a year.Although the date of their expected guilty plea has not yet been determined, the Massachusetts District Attorney’s Office announced on Thursday that Loughlin will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, while Giannulli will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and to honest services wire and mail fraud.If the judge accepts the terms of their plea agreement, both will do time in prison. Loughlin would serve two months and pay a $150,000 fine along with two years of supervised release and 100 hours of community service. Giannulli, meanwhile, would serve five months in prison, pay a $250,000 fine with two years of supervised release and 250 hours of community service.LORI LOUGHLIN MUST PREPARE FOR ‘TRIAL OF HER LIFE’ AFTER JUDGE REFUSES TO DISMISS CHARGES, LEGAL EXPERT SAYSNow, with the big hurdle seemingly behind the “Full House” alum, many questions remain as to whether Loughlin will be able to bounce back and salvage her career in show business and if the public will be able to see past her transgressions moving forward.“Hollywood tends to be pretty forgiving if it's a nonviolent crime and also it depends on the times we're living in. We're in a time where there's a lot of cheating and a lot of corruption and things going on that are very telling about people,” KerrPR President Cherie Kerr, who is not involved in the case, told Fox News on Thursday soon after the plea agreements were announced.LORI LOUGHLIN'S 'FULL HOUSE' CO-STAR DAVE COULIER SAYS HE 'WILL BE THERE FOR HER FOREVER' AMID SCANDAL DRAMAThe personal and corporate crisis manager continued: “For instance, the fact that [Lori] lied about both daughters' athletic ability – that's a real problem. That's worse than her just sending somebody some money as an influence and to get [her daughters] in and then say, 'Oh well, I didn't really know what I was doing and this guy [William 'Rick' Singer] put himself out to be someone who was just a coordinator to get my kids in school. So when you start lying as she did about her daughters and their background – and they found out they weren't rowers – that's the problem because that's really deceitful.”Kerr believes that Loughlin “should have walked off the field long ago” as her former co-defendant in the elaborate admissions scheme, actress Felicity Huffman, elected to do early on in the case before prosecutors put the squeeze on the remaining parents. Huffman served 11 of the 14 days handed to her and began completing her court-mandated community service back in November 2019.“She didn't fight it and get off and even if she had, there was a lot of damage done,” Kerr said. “It's generally not just one thing, but I think her career and her image is tainted from here on out because of what happened. If she's not well thought of as a mother, to a lot of people in the public that will be a big black mark against her.”Kerr said Loughlin should get ahead of the matter in the media, if permitted by the terms of her plea agreement, and should explain her reasoning behind making the large payments and staging the photos of her daughters -- Olivia Jade Giannulli and Isabella Giannulli -- for their admittance into the University of Southern California.LORI LOUGHLIN ‘OUTRAGED,’ DAUGHTER OLIVIA JADE ‘EMBARRASSED’ BY PROSECUTORS RELEASING ROWING PICS, REPORTS SAY“What happens with the press is that whoever has the most ink or airtime is the one where the public's sway is moved toward that side, but if she's not going to say anything and she's not going to do anything, I think she's going to have a problem,” said Kerr.“So if she has any kind of defense – if she wants to do a mea culpa or she wants to say this is really what went down and how it went down – we were desperate or whatever – she should be out there talking,” Kerr maintained. “Some people just decide to go away and leave it alone for a while. But I always say, if the story's out there and you made a deal and that's what you did and you have a way to explain that away – then do it.”“People used to go on with Barbara Walters for a whole hour and explain why they did what they did,” Kerr added.Prominent San Diego criminal defense attorney David Shapiro, also not attached to the matter, echoed the sentiment of Kerr that Loughlin’s chances of coming away victorious were slim and believes that a portion of the general public will scoff at the two months in federal prison Loughlin may have to serve behind bars if the judge accepts the terms of the plea agreement.LORI LOUGHLIN'S PLEA AGREEMENT: WHAT THE TERMS MEAN“Lori Loughlin’s fate was likely sealed, one way or the other, well before this guilty plea,” said Shapiro. “Some in the general public may not be happy with anything short of a lengthy prison commitment. She absolutely appears to have cheated the system, but got caught and now is labeled a felon.”“Only time shall tell what Loughlin’s legacy will be,” he added. “Many will remember her as ‘Aunt Becky’ from ‘Full House,’ and nothing more. Others will view this [pending] conviction as a black eye she can never recover from. Others will look back and see a mother who was willing to risk it all for the good of her children, albeit via illegal means.”However, current white-collar criminal defense attorney Michael Zweiback – who is a former Assistant U.S. Attorney and prosecutor in the Central District of California and is also not involved in the legal proceedings – takes the opposite view of Kerr, and while he’s sure that ""the stain will require a significant amount of time” for the matter to cycle out of the news, Loughlin “will have an opportunity to resume her career at some point.”“A lot depends upon how she acts from this point forward. Is she showing remorse? Does the narrative change from her being a victim of an overzealous government prosecution to ‘I am sorry for my actions?’"" Zweiback explained to Fox News on Thursday. “The judge will look to that when determining whether to accept this agreement and sentence her accordingly. [And] the public will also be watching for this.”OLIVIA JADE: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT LORI LOUGHLIN’S DAUGHTER AT THE CENTER OF THE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDALMeanwhile, considering the current happenings in the world and whether the ongoing coronavirus pandemic will hurt or help Loughlin’s ability to gain favor with the public, Kerr said there's a slippery slope to navigate in the fact that people may be so involved in their own life dealings that the outcome of the scandal could be eclipsed.“Well, that can play out on both sides. They can say, 'Yeah, who cares? We're in a much more serious situation and all she did was send some money and photos and got her kids in the school she wanted them to go to. That pales in comparison to what's happening otherwise,'"" Kerr explained. “But then they can also have a lot more time to sit and watch television and look at the news coverage because they're not working. So it can work both ways.”Kerr also anticipates that there will be a number of factors that will come into play on whether the scandal will define Loughlin and if Hollywood decides they’re willing to take a gamble on the fallen star.“That's really hard to say because it depends on what happens over the next few years,” said Kerr, who is often called upon by high-power attorneys to assist in image-strategizing for their clients. “And don't forget – and I think this is unfortunate the way it is – but she's an aging actress and her heyday was when she was quite a bit younger. So that's a factor that would have to be considered.”LORI LOUGHLIN 'NERVOUS' AFTER JUDGE REFUSES TO DISMISS CHARGES IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS CASE: REPORTAsked if Loughlin’s YouTube star daughter Olivia will be able to land on her feet in the eyes of the public following the scandal?

Lorena Bobbitt on revisiting her notorious case in Lifetime film: 'There was a lot of trauma',Exclusive,Stephanie Nolasco,2020-05-22,"Lorena Bobbitt became a household name nearly 30 years ago when she finally snapped.On the night of June 23, 1993, after suffering years of abuse, the then-24-year-old cut off the penis of her sleeping husband John Wayne Bobbitt, 26, in small-town Manassas, Va.The shocking case, which quickly became the subject of late-night comedy skits, is now the subject of a Lifetime film titled “I Was Lorena Bobbitt,” which follows the now-49-year-old’s account leading up to that fateful day. Bobbitt served as executive producer and on-screen narrator.Lifetime will also run a PSA for the National Domestic Violence Hotline and the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence featuring Bobbitt, as well as Dani Montalvo and Like Humphrey, who star as the controversial couple. The move is part of the network’s public affairs campaign Stop Violence Against Women.DETECTIVE RECALLS MEETING ‘TRUCK STOP KILLER’ BRUCE MENDENHALL IN ‘DEADLY RECALL’: ‘THERE’S EVIL OUT THERE’'FAMILIES OF THE MAFIA' STAR KAREN GRAVANO EXPLAINS WHY DAD SAMMY ‘THE BULL’ IS APPEARING ON MTV REALITY SHOW“I think it’s really important that we are releasing this film now,” Montalvo, 26, who plays Bobbitt, told Fox News. “Now more than ever. I think people are listening. People are starting to realize, 'Hey, women -- they might be onto something. They might be telling the truth. They might all have this one, awful, horrible thing in common. And there’s something that we can do about it.'”“I hope that it... inspires people to reach out,” she continued. “And if they see the signs, they see the patterns of any sort of domestic or sexual violence that they can act. And I think by watching the movie, that they will see what it looks like to live with that sort of reality.”On that night, Bobbitt, a young immigrant who had nowhere to go, fled the scene, organ in hand. She drove off from their home and flung the penis out of the driver’s side window into a field.Police later went digging through the overgrown roadside grass for the missing member, The New York Times reported. They found it, put it on ice in a Big Bite hot dog box from a nearby 7-Eleven and then rushed it to the hospital for the bleeding spouse. The former Marine then underwent surgery for nearly 10 hours and had it reattached.KIM KARDASHIAN DETAILS HER NEW DOC, SAYS SHE'S NOT WORRIED ABOUT JUSTICE REFORM CRITICS‘FORGOTTEN WEST MEMPHIS THREE’ DOC AIMS TO GIVE VICTIMS OF NOTORIOUS CRIME 'THEIR VOICES BACK,’ HOST SAYSAt the time, a distraught Bobbitt claimed she was raped by her drunk husband and simply couldn’t take years of physical, sexual and emotional abuse anymore. But the notorious cause would go on to be sensationalized by tabloids and Bobbitt was depicted as a pop-culture punchline.At the time, martial rape only recently had been made a crime in all 50 states and was nearly impossible to prove in Virginia, The New York Times reported.“For some reason, the media was just infatuated about the cutting of this penis instead of what actually is the essence and the core of the story,” Bobbitt told Fox News. “The story was about domestic violence, domestic abuse, sexual assault… the media just missed this window of opportunity to tell [that].”“We have to understand that the media has a big platform to influence people’s opinion,” she said. “So whenever I see tabloids and it’s all about... penis this and penis that, it was like, ‘Wow, they’re really missing [the point].’ And in the movie… you’ll see I was very traumatized because his trial went first. And I really believed that I was going to prison. I was going to jail. The whole thing was based on something else. There [wasn’t] a focus on the real story.”PRINCE ANDREW ACCUSER VIRGINIA ROBERTS GIUFFRE TO STAR IN NETFLIX DOC ABOUT JEFFREY EPSTEINHARVEY WEINSTEIN ACCUSER CAITLIN DULANY RESPONDS TO SENTENCING: ‘I CAN NOW CELEBRATE A TRULY HISTORIC VICTORY’Bobbitt admitted it was difficult to see her turbulent past play out on set during filming.“It was very [traumatizing],” she said. “When I arrived on the scene, actually I was not able to see the sexual-assault scene because I arrived two days later. They just finished filming it. But there were a lot of emotions. There was a lot of trauma. And I knew I was going to get into it. I was prepared mentally because first of all, I helped with the script and I’m an executive producer. I knew exactly what was going on. And that helped me to actually prepare myself to know what I was going to expect. That was my story. I know my story the best.”The couple was initially charged in separate trials, Rolling Stone reported. For her, it was malicious wounding and for him, it was martial sexual assault. However, both were acquitted. Bobbitt, whose trial was televised by Court TV, successfully pleaded not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. They officially divorced in 1995.The Lifetime film isn’t the first time Bobbitt has come forward to shed new light on her story. Back in 2019, Amazon Studios released “Lorena,” a four-part docuseries that was executive produced by Jordan Peele.GREEN RIVER KILLER GARY RIDGWAY IS STILL HIDING MANY 'DARK SECRETS' DESPITE CONFESSION, SAYS PROSECUTOR IN DOCUMENTARYMISSING IOWA TV JOURNALIST JODI HUISENTRUIT'S FAMILY STILL SEARCHING YEARS LATER, DOC REVEALS: ‘IT'S HORRIBLE'While Bobbitt had avoided turning the high-profile take into a film or TV series of the year, she agreed to participate in the Amazon project in hopes of setting the record straight. Her ex-husband also agreed to participate, although the 53-year-old later claimed he was allegedly set up to be depicted as “a violent mean guy.”In a statement to Fox News, filmmaker Joshua Rofé said: “Lorena, John Wayne and more than 40 other witnesses, attorneys, jurors and experts were interviewed over the course of a year to give this docuseries a complete picture of events that took place. This is something Lorena Gallo was not afforded 25 years ago when the story was misconstrued and unfairly sensationalized in the public eye.”In the years since the trial, John Wayne was arrested several times and served jail for violence against two different women, according to The New York Times. He also denied those allegations.Over the years, Bobbitt has focused on launching the Lorena Gallo Foundation, which is dedicated to raising awareness on domestic violence and offering support to loved ones.EX-JEHOVAH’S WITNESS RECOUNTS SEXUAL ABUSE IN DOC, ORGANIZATION DENIES TRYING TO COVER IT UPLAS VEGAS SHOOTING SURVIVORS RECALL ‘CHAOS AND TURMOIL’ OF HORRIFIC NIGHT, MEETING RESCUER, IN NEW DOCUMENTARYBobbitt hopes that the film -- and her story -- will compel other women to speak out and not suffer in silence.“I’m glad I have a platform now,” she said. “I have a voice to talk and communicate what really happened and to be transparent, be raw. These are real issues. These are real victims. They’re suffering right now. And not only here in the United States, but around the world. [It] is affecting many, many people… And I want them to understand that there’s hope… Maybe they can escape domestic violence by saying, ‘Hey, you know what? This is what happened to me. And I’m not going to be such in this abusive situation. I have resources. I can get away. I can get out in the end.’”“If my story helps at least one person to escape domestic violence, then my mission is complete,” she added. “My suffering was not in vain.”“I Was Lorena Bobbit” premieres Monday, May 25, at 8 p.m. ET on Lifetime.If you or someone you know is suffering from abuse, please contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673."

"Bulls championships with Doug Collins as head coach weren’t going to happen, former players say",NBA,Ryan Gaydos,2020-05-21,"Doug Collins failed to get an opportunity to lead Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls to an NBA championship and some former players believe it may have been a blessing in disguise for the former NBA superstar.Collins was out as head coach after losing in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1989. He was replaced with Phil Jackson, who would eventually help the Bulls win six championships.DENNIS RODMAN CALLS OUT FORMER BULLS TEAMMATES' COMPLAINTS ON PORTRAYAL IN 'THE LAST DANCE'Bill Cartwright and Ron Harper, two former Bulls players, believe that, while Collins was a great coach, he couldn’t have done the job Jackson did to take the Bulls to an NBA Finals victory. The two discussed Collins in a BetOnline video on Wednesday.“Probably not,” Cartwright said when asked whether the Bulls win a title with Collins. “One of the reasons why Doug was let go was because he was unable to incorporate Tex Winter, who was Jerry Krause’s first hire. Couple of interesting things happened. Once Phil was hired we incorporated Tex and the triangle. The other thing is we incorporated Al Vermiel, who was Jerry Krause’s second hire. I just think those two things are really integral and took us all the way with our game plan.”Harper agreed and added that Collins wanted Jordan to lead the league in scoring instead of building an offense in which everybody got involved.SPURS WOULD HAVE BEATEN MICHAEL JORDAN-LED BULLS IN HYPOTHETICAL 1999 NBA FINALS, EX-PLAYER SAYS“Jerry Krause made the move to hire Phil and Phil knew the only way they could win as a basketball team was to incorporate everybody,” Harper said. “The triangle offense allowed everybody to touch the basketball and play with the basketball.""“If you have one guy out there dominating the basketball and scoring the basketball, you ain’t going to win a lot of basketball games. You’re going to win a lot of games, but you ain’t going to be a championship team. Phil, the coaching staff, they allowed Phil to have more of a plan with MJ and say, ‘You’re going to score but we need the other guys to help the team. You’re going to score your points but we need you to get these guys to become better players in the roles they had.’ So without Phil and the coaching staff I don’t think they would have won a championship.”CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COMThe Jackson-coached Bulls won their first NBA title in 1991 as part of their first three-peat. He coached the Bulls until 1998 when the team disbanded. He would later coach the Los Angeles Lakers and win five more championships as their head coach."
Scottie Pippen's portrayal in 'The Last Dance' an issue with former Bulls players,NBA,Ryan Gaydos,2020-05-21,"Several former Chicago Bulls players believe Scottie Pippen got the short end of the straw during “The Last Dance” documentary and feel he should have been portrayed better.Craig Hodges, Bill Cartwright and Horace Grant discussed Pippen’s portrayal in discussion with BetOnline on Wednesday. All three former players felt Pippen should have been treated more fairly and that Chicago may not have had some of its great success without Pippen.SCOTTIE PIPPEN IS 'BEYOND LIVID' ABOUT HOW MICHAEL JORDAN PORTRAYED HIM IN 'THE LAST DANCE'The players mentioned Pippen electing not to rehab an injury until the start of the 1997-98 season and how Pippen sat for the final seconds of a 1994 playoff game against the New York, which the documentary revealed was addressed in the locker room after the game.“It was straight-up bulls—t. It was straight-up bulls—t how they portrayed Scottie,” Grant said. “First off, being the No. 2 on that team and how he came out in terms of against Utah could barely walk, setting screens, getting knocked on the floor, the whole nine yards, and for them, that documentary, to call him…well, MJ called him selfish, that’s some BS. That’s straight-up BS.“If it wasn’t for Scottie Pippen there would be no six championships. I’m telling you right now guys. The first championship I think MJ got in foul trouble against the Lakers and who came to the rescue? No. 33. Scottie Pippen. Scottie Pippen. Yes, he made a mistake. We addressed that after the game. And then it was over with and we took the Knicks to seven games. My question is: How in the hell did that get on this documentary when MJ’s a-s wasn’t even on the team.”DENNIS RODMAN CALLS OUT FORMER BULLS TEAMMATES' COMPLAINTS ON PORTRAYAL IN 'THE LAST DANCE'Cartwright said that the 1993-94 season was when Pippen evolved as a player because he didn’t have Jordan and made a mistake in the infamous Knicks game.“It’s interesting that when the play when Pip did not come back in the game, that was Pip’s best year. He had evolved into a leadership role, played great,” Cartwright said. “To me, people make mistakes and then you move on from them. I think Scottie has a big heart. And when I first got to the Bulls he wasn’t a great shooter, skinny, extraordinarily talented, so everything he had he worked for. For me Pip was a great teammate and like I said it was one man’s show and that’s what they saw. But that’s not really reality.”Hodges was Pippen’s teammate for the final four years of his career, from 1989 to 1992. He said he feels like Michael Jordan would not have won anything without Pippen.“I’m still kind of upset about it because I know the type of brother that Scottie is. Scottie is the type of brother, I wasn’t part of the team when he didn’t stand up and come back out and play during that play, but I know that Scottie is the type of cat that will give his shirt for you, go on the ground for you and kick out the shot for you. I didn’t like how he was portrayed and I don’t understand the reasoning behind it and I’m still trying to figure that out,” Hodges said.PICTURE OF MICHAEL JORDAN'S ICONIC SHOT REVEALS LOTS OF HIDDEN GEMS, PHOTOGRAPHER SAYS“Without Scottie, MJ would not have won. It’s like all the brothers sitting here. It’s almost like MJ won in a vacuum and it wasn’t anything like that. To throw your brother, especially no. 33, under the bus, that wasn’t cool.”WARNING - GRAPHIC LANGUAGEAccording to David Kaplan of ESPN 1000 in Chicago, Pippen, who won six NBA championships with Jordan and the Chicago Bulls during the ‘90s, is “so angry” and “beyond livid” at his teammate for how he came across in the documentary.Pippen’s unhappiness derives from Jordan calling him ""selfish"" and that he ""didn't realize what he was getting himself into"" with the 10-part series that spanned five weeks.CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM""[Pippen] felt like up until the last few minutes of Game 6 against the Jazz [in the 1998 NBA Finals], it was just 'bash Scottie, bash Scottie, bash Scottie,'"" Kaplan said Wednesday.Fox News’ Dan Canova contributed to this report."

Sign up here.Los Angeles Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald is not a fan of the idea of playing games without fans in the stadium, as the coronavirus pandemic is sure to affect whether there are any spectators in 2020.Donald said during a video conference with NFL media on Thursday that playing in front of empty seats “wouldn’t be fun to me.”TOM BRADY'S NEW TEAMMATE REVEALS WHAT IT'S LIKE WORKING WITH THE FUTURE HALL OF FAME QUARTERBACK“I feel like you need fans to play the game,” Donald said. “I don’t see how you could play a game without the fans. I feel like that takes out the excitement and the fun out of the game.”Donald has had double-digit sacks in four out of his six professional seasons. Last year, Donald recorded 12.5 sacks and 48 total tackles in all of the Rams’ 16 games. He’s been selected to the Pro Bowl in each of his six seasons.The Rams’ star knows that the decision isn’t up to him on whether fans can return to the stadiums in 2020, but feels that they add a certain element to the game.COWBOYS' DAK PRESCOTT CONTRACT RUMORS CONTINUE TO SWIRL AMID NEGOTIATIONS“I feel like the fans pick you up,” he said. “The fans are what makes the game exciting. The fans would give you that extra juice when you're tired and fatigued. When you make that big play and you hear 80,000 fans going crazy, that pumps you up.

Tokyo Olympics followed up by 3 mega-events -- all in China,Olympics,,2020-05-22,"Uncertainty grips next year’s postponed Tokyo Olympics: Will there be fans or empty stadiums in 14 months? And how will thousands of athletes, staff, and technical officials travel, be housed, and stay safe amid COVID-19?And Tokyo is not alone.China — where the COVID-19 outbreak was first detected — will hold three mega-sports events within a year after Tokyo is set to close.CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COMThe World University Games in Chengdu in western China open 10 days after the Tokyo Games close, with up to 8,000 athletes. Next come the Beijing Winter Olympics beginning on Feb. 4, 2022, and the Asian Games in Hangzhou starting on Sept. 10. The previous edition of the Asian Games in Indonesia drew 11,000 athletes and featured more sports than the Olympics.A fourth major event, soccer’s 24-team Club World Championship, was to open in China in June of 2021, but has been postponed because of scheduling conflicts created by the pandemic.China is a go-to country for these mega events, through expertise gained from the 2008 Beijing Olympics and because it absorbs the massive costs. It spent at least $40 billion to organize the 2008 Olympics, and there was no national debate since the authoritarian state prohibits voting or referendums.Voters in Europe and North America have repeatedly said “no” to referendums to hold the games. China landed the 2022 Winter Olympics when several European bidders withdrew. Beijing won narrowly in a vote by the IOC against Almaty, Kazakhstan.“Telling the citizens of Bavaria or Switzerland that another Winter Olympics would benefit them greatly doesn’t work,” Jonathan Grix, who studies sports policy at Manchester Metropolitan University, wrote in an email. He said voters sense that “citizens rarely benefit the most from such events.”“Authoritarian states have no need to ask the populace, they have no need to compromise on policy, there is no political opposition (by definition) and most delivery services are state-run, ensuring the smooth running of the event,“ Grix added.Japanese and International Olympic Committee officials have given few details about how the Tokyo Olympics will be staged, the cost of postponement, and who will pay for it. They’ve teased the problems and floated tenuous solutions. They’ve agreed on one thing: If the games can’t open on July 23, 2021, they’ll be canceled.In a joint news conference last weekend, the director general of the World Health Organization cautioned it would not be “easy” to make the Olympics a safe global gathering spot.But Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed confidence: “I think it’s possible,”IOC President Thomas Bach has been cautious in speculating how the Olympics can be held. He’s suggested a possible quarantine for athletes, hinted at limited fan access to venues, and has not ruled out events in empty stadiums. Of course, he says that’s not his preference.IOC member John Coates, who oversees preparations for Tokyo, has been direct.“We’ve got real problems because we’ve got athletes having to come from 206 different nations,” Coates said, speaking at a News Corp Australia digital forum and reported in The Australian newspaper. “We’ve got 11,000 athletes coming, 5,000 technical officials and coaches, 20,000 media."" There's also about 4,000 working on the organizing committee and an expected 60,000 volunteers.""Some scientists in Japan and elsewhere believe a vaccine is needed to guarantee safety for athletes. But some have asked if young, healthy athletes should be a priority for vaccination.The biggest challenge might be guaranteeing the safety of fans who have already bought millions of tickets. If there are no fans, will there be refunds? Will there be lawsuits? Tickets provide at least $800 million income for local organizers with the added cost of postponement estimated in Japan at $2 billion to $6 billion.Eric Saintrond, the CEO of the FISU — the Switzerland-based governing body of the World University Games — said in an email to The Associated Press that decisions related to “security and health will be taken” by the Chinese government. He said final decisions in this area do “not in fact rest with FISU.” He said all preparations were “on track.”University Games spokesman Wang Guangliang was asked about housing for athletes, fans, and so forth, but offered little clarity, deflecting back to the FISU.“The impact of the pandemic is still unforeseeable and we are still studying the situation and need to discuss with FISU about what to do to reduce the impact and ensure the safety of all participants,” Wang wrote in a email to the AP.Postponing the Summer Olympics by a year has raised questions about marketing the Winter Olympics, which open six months after Tokyo closes. Construction is on schedule, but sponsors may face challenges.“Sponsors and business partners of the games will have to keep investing extra money in their marketing programs for Tokyo if the games are postponed, potentially forcing them to reduce their budgets for the next Olympics,” Wei Jizhong, a former secretary general of the Chinese Olympic Committee, told the China Daily.The Associated Press emailed questions about Beijing 2022 preparations to Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC vice president who oversees Beijing preparations. He did not immediately reply to the request, nor to a follow-up. Beijing could also face the issues of athlete quarantines, fewer fans, and the fear of spreading the virus even more.In an interview in February with China’s official Xinhua News Agency, Samaranch was laudatory about preparations. He praised Beijing organizers, President Xi Jinping, who heads of the Chinese Communist Party, and China’s handling of the virus.Sheena Greitens, who studies Asian politics at the University of Texas at Austin, said large sports events give China high visibility and “can keep reporters focused on the sporting events rather than having them use their time in-country to dig around on other topics that might reflect poorly on the CCP (Chinese Communist Party).”“They provide a way for China to boost its cultural and ‘discourse power’ globally,” Greitens wrote in an email. “And they do so in a forum that generally emphasizes international cooperation and is weighted away from the serious disagreements that many countries have with China over territorial conflict, human rights, and trade, among other topics.”"

It’s a potentially huge turnaround after years in which companies like Amazon and Google chased scarce tech talent by opening or expanding offices in hip urban locations such as San Francisco and New York.Such a shift might also amount to a repudiation of the notion that creative work demands corporate campuses reminiscent of college, with free food, ping pong tables and open office plans designed to encourage unplanned interactions.CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOWThe result could re-imagine not just Silicon Valley but other cities as the companies expand hiring in places like Atlanta, Dallas and Denver, where Facebook plans to open new “hubs” for its new, mostly remote hires.It’s too early to know whether remote work options will mean an exodus of highly-paid tech workers from San Francisco and Silicon Valley, where they’ve contributed to skyrocketing rents and housing prices. But Facebook’s employee survey suggests that at least some of its employees would leave the San Francisco Bay Area if given the option.For companies that have built their empires on letting people communicate with far-flung friends and colleagues, moving toward remote work is not too hard of a sell. But there are many challenges. Collaboration, spontaneity, face-to-face interactions that aren’t on a scheduled call — all look different when people are working alone from their homes.There are also some jobs — in Facebook’s case, the toughest content reviewing that deals with suicides, child abuse and other traumatizing material; sales; building, upgrading and maintaining data centers; lawyers who have to be in court and so on — that can’t be done remotely.Newer employees, especially recent college grads or those with little experience and lower performers might also fall into this group, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg during an employee town hall Thursday that was broadcast live on his Facebook page. At Facebook, the CEO said employees will have to meet certain criteria to be considered for permanent remote work. This includes a level of seniority, strong performance and, naturally, being part of a team that supports remote work.For now, workers at Facebook, Google, Twitter and elsewhere can work remotely through 2020.CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGEAt Microsoft, employees can work from home until October. But the company’s work-from-home flexibility has fit with the software giant’s broader effort to capitalize on what CEO Satya Nadella calls a shift to “remote everything.”“Every organization will increasingly need the ability at a moment’s notice to remote everything from manufacturing to sales, to customer support,” Nadella said this week at the company’s Build developer conference.The company’s chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, had already been working a lot from home, in part because he is based in Silicon Valley and most of the rest of the leadership team is in Redmond, Wash.“We are all on this accelerated timeline figuring out how to work from home.... It’s learning the culture and the rhythms of interacting with your colleagues by video conference and doing your work remotely,” he said, speaking not just of Microsoft but workplaces in general. “That is getting so much better so quickly that I don’t think I’m going to be commuting nearly as frequently as I was before.”The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Restaurants have many options to drive business besides third-party marketplaces, none of which are seeing their fees regulated.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPCities have moved to cap fees that delivery companies can charge. DoorDash even cut its commission fees in half, and Uber Eats says it stopped charging delivery fees for more than 100,000 independent restaurants in an effort to help.The caps, which have been implemented in several cities across the U.S., have been vehemently opposed by Grubhub, claiming they would hinder restaurants' earnings.""On the face of it, a cap on fees seems to be an easy solution to help restaurants that are struggling due to the coronavirus. And there is nothing we want more than to ensure the health of independent restaurants -- we don’t have a business without them,"" the statement read.""But this solution is exactly the wrong thing to do. In reality, this proposed cap will lower order volume to locally-owned restaurants, increase costs -- and headaches -- for small business owners, and raise costs to customers. Delivery workers, who are currently relying on Grubhub to earn an income including 100 percent of tips from diners, would have fewer work opportunities and lower earnings. In the middle of what is quickly becoming one of the worst economic downturns in a century, Grubhub is ensuring that workers in New York City can continue to provide for themselves and their families.""A spokesperson for DoorDash did not respond to requests for comment."

"Intense fitness classes can lead to rapid spread of COVID-19, report shows",Coronavirus,Rachael Rettner | LiveScience,2020-05-21,"Fitness dance classes are yet another venue where the new coronavirus appears to easily spread, according to a new report.The report found that dozens of people in South Korea caught COVID-19 after participating in fitness dance classes at the beginning of the pandemic.The researchers traced the cluster back to a workshop that was held for fitness dance instructors in Cheonan, South Korea, on Feb. 15, according to the report, published May 15 in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The workshop involved four hours of intense training, the report said. Among the 27 fitness instructors who participated, eight later tested positive for COVID-19, although none had symptoms on the day of the workshop.Not knowing they had COVID-19, those instructors then went on to teach their own fitness dance classes.By March 9, the researchers had identified 112 COVID-19 cases tied to fitness dance classes at 12 different sports facilities in Cheonan.About half of the cases occurred due to direct transmission from instructors to students during classes, which lasted nearly an hour and met twice a week. The rest of the cases (not including the instructors themselves) occurred due to spread from the students to their family members or coworkers.The researchers noted that the classes involved many people engaging in high-intensity exercise in a small space — a pretty ideal environment for COVID-19 spread.""The moist, warm atmosphere in a sports facility coupled with turbulent air flow generated by intense physical exercise can cause more dense transmission of isolated droplets,"" the authors said.The number of people in a class also appeared to play a role in disease spread: Typical-size classes, with up to 22 participants, resulted in disease spread, while small classes with fewer than five people did not result in any spread of COVID-19, the report found.Interestingly, one of the infected instructors also taught yoga and pilates, but none of these students became infected. The authors hypothesized that the lower intensity of these activities did not result in the same level of transmission as the high-intensity fitness classes.Overall, ""because of the increased possibility of infection through droplets, vigorous exercise in closely confined spaces should be avoided during the current outbreak,"" the authors concluded.Originally published on Live Science."

The findings are the culmination of several research projects by the same team on human resilience, including experiments on the ability of the human face to take a punch and the human hands’ efficacy as melee weapons.“We found that fully furred samples were capable of absorbing more energy than plucked and sheared samples,” according to the jaw-dropping experiment conducted by biologists Ethan Beseris, Steven Naleway and David Carrier.Fortunately, no humans were slugged in the name of science. Instead, the team employed an epoxy composite skull covered in several styles of sheep skin — plucked, trimmed, and full-on mutton chops (so to speak).

Poll: 36 percent of Americans less likely to take coronavirus vaccine if Trump says it's safe,Donald Trump,Caitlin McFall,2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.A new Reuters/Ipsos poll showed that a quarter of Americans have “little to no interest” in taking a coronavirus vaccine and are skeptical that the safety of the vaccine could be compromised based on the rate of which vaccines are being developed amid the outbreak.Of those surveyed, 36 percent also said they would be “less willing” to take a coronavirus vaccine that President Trump “said was safe,” compared to the 14 percent who said they would be “more interested” based on the president’s advice.The poll, which surveyed 4,428 adults between May 13 and May 19, pointed to a consistent lack of trust between pollsters and the president.CDC NOW SAYS CORONAVIRUS 'DOES NOT SPREAD EASILY' VIA CONTAMINATED SURFACESMost of the survey’s pollsters said they would be “heavily influenced by guidance from the Food and Drug Administration [FDA].”According to Reuters, at least 70 percent of Americans would need to reach immunity, either from vaccination or by previously having the virus, in order for the country to reach “herd immunity.”MICHIGAN AG TELLS TRUMP TO WEAR MASK WHILE VISITING FORD PLANT: IT'S 'THE LAW'Health experts agree that a vaccine needs to be developed in order for Americans to return to normal life.

Financial fallout of COVID-19 hits Montana ranch that helps female veterans fight PTSD,Fox News Flash,Emily DeCiccio,2020-05-21,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.Lisa Ledoux and her mother have been operating Serenity Ranch in Montana since May 2016, providing free equine therapy to female veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other traumas.The economic fallout of COVID-19, however, has taken a toll on Serenity Ranch and is forcing the horse rescue facility to roll back its critical equine therapy programs and sell nearly 40 acres of land.“This year, unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will be unable to do a female veteran program,” said Ledoux. “We’ll be taking care of the horses, and that's kind of what we've been focusing on more lately since the pandemic started, just because the donations that we were receiving have gone down significantly.”Ledoux explained to Fox News that it’s just her and her mom taking care of the ranch and the horses. She broke down the high operating costs and noted that a bale of hay, for example, is $120, and the horses go through one bale in about a day-and-a-half.""The hay cost alone is very pricey, not to mention maintenance of our land, making sure fencing is up to par so horses don't get out,” said Ledoux. “We have to trim our horses’ feet, which is not an easy task either ... and just to do that is about $2,000 to $3,000, so the cost of running the place adds up.”Ledoux and her mother depend on donations to run Serenity Ranch and offer free-of-charge equine therapy to at-risk women. Their dedication comes from their firsthand account of equine therapy when they both experienced loss. When Ledoux’s stepfather died suddenly of a heart attack, they learned how effective working with horses could be when coping with trauma.“The horses are truly healing and they helped us through some really rough times,” said Ledoux. “We wanted to share that, so we established the Serenity Ranch.”A six- to seven-day stay at the ranch includes resilience training with a licensed coach, lessons from a local veterinarian so the women can learn how to tackle first aid issues with the horses, and writing sessions. The women get paired with a horse and they ride that particular horse for the duration of the week.Air Force veteran Cari Simmons explained to Fox News how Serenity Ranch's program impacted her.""Not only was I able to bond with other veterans in magical place of true serenity, the owners and staff at the ranch offered me unconditional acceptance so I could find my voice and confidence again,"" said Simmons. ""On top of that, the herd of magical horses who live on the ranch touched my heart in ways that allowed me to love again — not only them but myself as well. I am so very grateful.""Ledoux and her mother have been rescuing diverse breeds of horses for about 15 years and currently have 41 horses at Serenity Ranch. The mother-daughter duo takes on horses that people may no longer want and also facilitate rescue operations. For example, two years ago, Ledoux and her mother assisted a rescue from a hoarding situation of 40 horses.“That situation was awful, the horses hadn't been cared for or they hadn't been fed, and they hadn't been watered,” said Ledoux. “So we took the 40 horses onto our property, and I am happy to say that most of them have either been homed or adopted.”Ledoux noted that the horses with traumatic pasts truly connect with the women who have suffered trauma themselves, and noted the healing properties of the human-horse connection.“When you're leading a horse, you have to be in the present, and if you're thinking about what you ate for breakfast or thinking about what you were gonna have for lunch or anything, the horses know and will act out,” explained Ledoux. “They might rear up, they might kick, so in order to handle a horse, your brain has to be in a state of complete presence, and you have to be in the moment.”For more on how Serenity Ranch is helping veterans watch the full interview with Serenity Ranch founder Lisa Ledoux above.Emily DeCiccio is a reporter and video producer for Fox News Digital Originals.

""We have intentionally partnered with Team Red White and Blue and other like minded organizations to build a robust, and united effort to honor the fallen and support the military during this time of separation.”Hallett told Fox News that “wear blue” and Team RWB are “calling on our nation to come together in shared steps outside of our back doors.”“Our goal is 50,000 runners committed to running or walking in honor of the fallen,” Hallett said, noting that the organization has also partnered with Amazon, VISA and more to make the event happen. “We recognize that now, more than ever, we are stronger together.”Hallett told Fox News that “Amazon and its 25,000 military veterans joined 'wear blue' in creating a virtual training program as part of a stay healthy-stay connected campaign that we developed together.”“Amazon employees have been sharing their weekly training and preparing to run a 5k this Memorial Day,” Hallett told Fox News. “We are excited to partner with them, and grateful for their generous support of our programming.”A spokesperson for Amazon confirmed to Fox News the company's involvement.Hallett added that VISA also had a military and veteran network and “is joining us in running this Memorial Day.”This Memorial Day, Hallett invited runners, walkers and supporters to download the “Motigo” app, which will feature messages from families of the fallen, and fellow service members, sharing stories about their loved ones and what Memorial Day means to them.Participation is at no cost, Hallett told Fox News, saying that runners, walkers and supporters “simply commit a meaningful number of miles to run or walk or move on Memorial Day.”“On Memorial Day, we ask that our community shares their honored hero with others on their social media channels, with the challenge, for the examples and motivation of these heroes to live in how we live,” Hallett said.Meanwhile, in 2017, “wear blue” launched a program dedicated to Gold Star children called the “wear blue Gold Star Youth Mentorship Program,” which pairs active duty military with children of fallen service members.This year, Gold Star children, with the support of the USAA Foundation, have been training virtually to run a Memorial Day 5K.“Each week, we join a Zoom call, and discuss training tips and setting and achieving smart goals,” Hallett told Fox News. “They are running for purposeful steps on Memorial Day in honor of their fallen parents.”Hallett explained that on Memorial Day, runners will be invited to join a “Zoom Circle of Remembrance,” and then will begin to walk or run in honor of their fallen hero.AMERICA TOGETHER: MORE STORIES OF THE AMERICAN SPIRIT“I am proud of 'wear blue: run to remember' and Team RWB, as we join our communities in a nationwide effort to honor and remember our fallen military heroes on this Memorial Day,” Hallett told Fox News. “On Monday, May 25, we will speak the names and share the stories of the men and women who volunteered to serve their countries and gave the last full measure in doing so. And in this act, we are reminded of our potential and our call to rise.”“wear blue” originally was founded following the redeployment of 5-2 Stryker Brigade Combat Team, a unit that, while deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, sustained a significant amount of combat losses and casualties. During that deployment, a small group of 5-2 wives and battalion support staff met weekly to run, seeking to create a support network for one another. When the brigade returned, Hallett, and co-founder, Erin O’Connor, turned the small group into a nationwide vision.Hallett told Fox News that the program has had a very personal impact on her family. Her husband, Capt. John Hallett, was killed on Aug. 25, 2009, just three weeks after the birth of their third child, Heidi, and just six weeks after his deployment with 5th Stryker Brigade to Shah Wali Kot district in Kandahar. Capt. Hallett was killed when his unit encountered an improvised explosive device.“It’s been over 10 years since my husband Capt. John Hallett was killed in combat. Our three children are growing up … they are anxious to hear the stories of the young adult they are striving to become — stories of John that often feel too far away,” Hallett explained.“In military service, there is not always the space to tell the stories of our fallen friends and leaders,” she continued. “As community members, there are not always words strong enough to say thank you, or I am sorry for your loss. But on Memorial Day, our steps become the words and the stories.”Hallett added that as her children grow up “it’s bittersweet to see John on their faces and in their actions, as well as their own desires to know the man they barely met.”CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP“I’m grateful for this day that we share with our country our pride,” she said. “And they share with us their strength and remembrance.”“When I look at the streets across America, and I witness a nation moving in red, white and blue, I know that you remember. I know that you care, and I know that John's legacy and the legacies of all our fallen endure in how we live,” Hallett said. “We must now, more than ever, hold steady to the charge to live a life worthy of such sacrifices.”o join this no-cost virtual walk or run in honor of our nation's fallen military, please visit https://www.wearblueruntoremember.org/."

No wonder many auto companies left Michigan, until I came along!”Trump did wear a mask for part of the tour of the plant that has been repurposed to make medical supplies, but refused to put it on in front of reporters -- although at least one photographer snapped a photo that was posted on social media. It showed the president wearing a mask that included the presidential seal.""I had one on before,” Trump told reporters during the visit. “I wore one on in this back area.

I had goggles and a mask right back there.”TRUMP BRINGS MASK TO FORD, SAYS HE DOESN'T 'WANT TO GIVE THE PRESS THE PLEASURE OF SEEING' HIM WEARING ITHe added it wasn’t necessary to wear a mask around reporters and Ford representatives in the front of the plant because “Everybody's been tested.”Nessel told CNN the state would be speaking to Ford about allowing the president to go without a mask for the public portion of the tour in what she said was a violation of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive order requiring masks in enclosed public spaces.""They knew exactly what the order was and if they permitted anyone, even the president of the United States, to defy that order, I think it has serious health consequences potentially to their workers,” Nessel told CNN.She also said she was ""ashamed"" to have him as the president and she hoped Michigan voters ""will remember this when November comes, that he didn't care enough about their safety, he didn't care about their welfare, he didn't respect them enough just to engage in the very simple task, the painless task, the easy task of wearing a mask when he was provided one.""Trump suggested in another tweet that Ford might leave Michigan if it's held accountable for his actions.“Do nothing A.G. of the Great State of Michigan, Dana Nessel, should not be taking her anger and stupidity out on Ford Motor - they might get upset with you and leave the state, like so many other companies have - until I came along and brought business back to Michigan.

Like other states, Michigan sent out absentee applications, not ballots. Trump corrected his tweet — but the threat to withhold federal dollars to Michigan stood. Michigan's secretary of state said Trump is still wrong.But the issue of whether Trump will wear a mask has been front and center before Trump visits the critical swing state.Michigan has been especially hard hit by the coronavirus, with more than 50,000 confirmed cases and 5,000 deaths.Everyone, including Trump, has an obligation to follow the law, the attorney general said.""We must all do our part to stop the spread of COVID-19,"" Nessel wrote.

"From building trucks to ventilators, Ford plant’s crisis response on display during Trump's Michigan visit",Proud American,Marisa Schultz,2020-05-21,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.When President Trump arrives in Michigan Thursday, he'll get a chance to see one of the success stories of America's innovative all-hands-on-deck response to the coronavirus pandemic.Trump will tour the Ford Motor Co. Rawsonville plant that reconfigured its operations during the pandemic and shifted from making automobiles to ventilators to help save lives.And much like how Detroit was the Arsenal of Democracy during World War II, with Ford's Willow Run plant producing one B-24 Liberator airplane per hour, the workers on today's pandemic response assembly line feel a similar sense of pride for helping fellow Americans during hard times.""I could not be more proud of my fellow rank and file workers,"" said Terry Bowman, a Ford Motor Co. Rawsonville plant employee who is working on the ventilator project.""They could have stayed home all safe and sound. But yet, all of these workers ... decided on their own, that they wanted to come in and work on a ventilator project in the middle of this pandemic.""Bowman, 54, normally makes transmission oil pumps for trucks at the Ypsilanti Township plant, then the pandemic came and stay-home orders hit. Ford closed the plant and Bowman went on unemployment in March.FORD SAYS TRUMP SHOULD WEAR MASK WHEN VISITING PLANT ON THURSDAYWhen Congress passed the more than $2 trillion CARES Act in March, workers on unemployment got an additional $600 per week payment from the federal government on top of the normal state benefits. In Michigan, the maximum rate is $362 per week. So with the added federal boost, laid-off autoworkers could get $962 a week. That rate would amount to more than $50,000 a year.So when Ford put out the call for workers to voluntarily come back to work to make ventilators and personal protective equipment, some of those who stepped up were making less money by putting their health on the line to work than by staying home and collecting unemployment checks, said Bowman.""A lot of the workers are actually working only 40 hours and making less than what they would have if they would have just stayed home and received the additional $600 unemployment,"" said Bowman, who ended up making more because of overtime.""All these volunteer workers did not have to be there but decided to come in to be a part of something bigger than themselves,"" he added.In all, more than 1,000 Ford employees signed up to work at four southeast Michigan auto plants that have been converted to make ventilators and personal protective equipment. Other plants are making masks, respirators and face shields.General Electric was called up to make ventilators by Trump under the Defense Production Act. Ford Motor Company became GE's supplier and began ventilator production in late April.Ford converted an unused portion of the Rawsonville plant to build out the ventilator manufacturing unit. Ford intends to manufacture 50,000 of the GE/Airon Model A-E ventilators by mid-July.The ventilator model is unique because it runs on compressed air, not electricity, so it doesn't need to be plugged it. It's ideal for a quick setup in an emergency, on the battlefield and during the transport of patients.Ford said it dubbed the ventilator and PPE production “Project Apollo” after the Apollo 13 launch in 1970 when a lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank failed two days into the mission, forcing the astronauts to improvise a fix.TRUMP HITS THE SWING STATES, EVEN WITH CAMPAIGN BATTLE IN CORONAVIRUS LIMBOBowman, who is co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party and active on the Trump campaign, said he wrote the White House to invite Trump to see firsthand the effort of Ford workers helping in the coronavirus crisis.Despite working 37 days straight, Bowman said the mood on the ventilator assembly is very positive as workers have the patriotic spirit of helping serve the country during the global pandemic. Michigan has been especially hard hit by the pandemic. Nationwide, more than 1.5 million people have been sickened by the contagious virus and more than 93,000 Americans have died.""The ventilator project was brought about by the Defense Production Act, which hasn't really been used in 78 years, so I thought it was pretty historic,"" Bowman said on his decision to sign up for the project. ""I wanted to be a part of something historic.""My family has all been healthy, and I thought there's a moral issue to this: Shouldn't you go back and help people who might need ventilators? I just thought it was the right thing to do.""THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNFord is taking additional precautions for workers on the special coronavirus projects and as the auto manufacturing begins to reopen. Before Bowman heads to work, he logs online at home and answers a questionnaire to certify that he doesn't have symptoms. When he arrives, he has a no-touch temperature scan. All employees wear a face mask at work. Safety glasses with side shields or face shields are also required for jobs that don't allow for social distancing.""I feel safer at work than I do anywhere,"" Bowman said.Trump's visit to Michigan marks his latest travel to a swing state in an effort to demonstrate his desire to get American back to work. Trump is expected to tout America as ""the king of ventilators"" and to praise the collaboration between Ford and General Electric.The two U.S. companies ""have stepped up to make ventilators and PPE in a time of need -- exemplifying the power of the American spirit and ingenuity at work,"" the White House said in a statement. ""Ford has a rich history stepping up in a time of crisis. During WWII, their Willow Run assembly plant was producing one B-24 per hour.""CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPThe White House also applauded Ford for its American pride.

Andrew McCarthy: Flynn judge must explain his astounding and offensive refusal to dismiss charges,OPINION,Andrew McCarthy,2020-05-22,"Is U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan’s collusion cameo nearing its end?On Thursday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, on its own motion, ordered Judge Sullivan to respond within 10 days to the petition for a writ of mandamus filed by former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.Earlier this week, Flynn’s counsel, Sidney Powell, filed the petition for that extraordinary writ, asking the appellate court to instruct Sullivan to grant the Justice Department’s motion to dismiss the case against Flynn.FEDERAL APPEALS COURT ORDERS JUDGE IN FLYNN CASE TO RESPOND TO MOTION TO DISMISS CHARGESCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERThat was after Judge Sullivan not only declined to grant the prosecution’s motion, but (a) invited non-parties to intervene in the case by filing amicus briefs (transparently, to make arguments that he somehow has authority to deny DOJ’s motion); and (b) appointed one amicus, former federal judge John Gleeson, as a quasi-prosecutor to make arguments that prosecutors are declining to make in favor of entering a judgment of conviction and sentencing Flynn.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAs I noted Wednesday, Sullivan’s encouragement of amicus briefs, which are not authorized in criminal cases, flies in the face of Sullivan’s own very firm orders previously declining to permit amicus briefs in Flynn’s case – some two dozen times by Powell’s count.The appointment of Gleeson is equally astonishing and offensive to the principle of courts as impartial arbiters.CLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEWCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY"

Sign up here.Attorney Sidney Powell has fired a broadside at Judge Emmet Sullivan.On Tuesday, she filed a writ of mandamus asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to order Sullivan to grant the Justice Department’s motion to dismiss the case against her client, Gen. Michael Flynn.The Court of Appeals should issue that order and override Sullivan’s unprecedented and, frankly, bizarre behavior in opening up the criminal prosecution of Flynn to input from outside parties and appointing John Gleeson, a former federal prosecutor and retired federal judge (who recently penned an op-ed attacking the Justice Department), to argue against the department’s motion.ANDREW McCARTHY: THE SUSAN RICE MICHAEL FLYNN CYA EMAILGleeson has even told Sullivan that he may need to engage in “additional factual development.” In other words, a nonparty, private lawyer is making the astounding proposal that he be given the powers of a government prosecutor.The Justice Department moved to dismiss the charges against Flynn after an internal investigation revealed troubling information about the prosecution. The department concluded that it could not prove its case to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.The department has now determined that the FBI had no evidence justifying an interview of Flynn in the first place. That interview resulted in the claim that Flynn “lied” to the FBI. A valid prosecution would require that the alleged lie be “material” to an investigation. Since there was no legitimate basis for an investigation, the “materiality” requirement could not be met.Rather than try to respond to the procedural nightmare Sullivan has created, Powell is now trying to go over his head.So what is a writ of mandamus? It is a request that a higher court order a lower court to perform its duty properly. The power of mandamus is given to federal appellate courts by The All Writs Act (28 U.S.C. § 1651). As a Justice Department manual on court procedures notes: “Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, which should only be used in exceptional circumstances of peculiar emergency or public importance.”In Cheney v. U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (2004), the Supreme Court established three conditions that Flynn – or any other petitioner – must meet before a writ can be granted:he must demonstrate that he has “no other adequate means to obtain the relief” he requires;his right to the writ must be “clear and indisputable;”the court “in the exercise of its discretion must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.”Powell makes a strong case that this matter meets all of those requirements.Powell also argues that Judge Sullivan’s behavior in the case “reveal[s] a deep-seated antagonism” toward Flynn.Powell argues that by refusing to grant the government’s motion to dismiss, Sullivan has “exceeded” his authority, “egregiously abused” his discretion, and is defying precedents of both the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court. That includes a 2016 decision, U.S. v. Fokker Servs., in which the Court of Appeals said that the power of a district court judge like Sullivan is “narrow” and circumscribed when the government requests the dismissal of a prosecution.That power is limited to ensuring that government prosecutors are not engaging in harassment by repeated prosecutions – dismissing a case only to refile it again later against the same defendant. Here, it appears that it is the judge who is engaging in possible harassment, not the prosecution. The Court of Appeals specifically said in Fokker that a judge can’t deny a motion to dismiss a prosecution just because the judge “has a disagreement with the prosecution’s” decision.Moreover, Powell points out that, by opening up the case to third parties to file amicus briefs and appointing a retired judge to argue against the government, Sullivan is acting in direct defiance of another Supreme Court decision issued less than two weeks ago.In U.S. v. Sineneng-Smith, a unanimous court chastised (and vacated a ruling by) the Ninth Circuit for engaging in similar behavior, opening up a criminal case to third parties to file amicus briefs and instructing them to address an issue that had not been raised by either the government or the defendant in the case.Powell also argues that Sullivan’s behavior in the case “reveal[s] a deep-seated antagonism” toward Flynn. At Flynn’s initial sentencing hearing, she notes, Sullivan “publicly berated” Flynn, although the government had reassured the judge that Flynn had given them “substantial cooperation.” The judge, she writes, “suggested [Flynn] may have committed ‘treason,’ asserted that he had ‘sold [his] country out,’ and expressed ‘disdain’ and ‘disgust’ for General Flynn’s conduct – flat wrong on crucial facts of the case.”CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERPowell argues that these criticisms “even uttered in private conversation,” would be grounds for Sullivan to recuse himself from the case. Saying “them to the world” makes “fair judgment impossible.”This is the United States, not France or one of the handful of other countries where the roles of prosecutors and judges are combined. As Powell correctly argues, our Constitution places the law enforcement and prosecutorial functions in the executive branch, not the judicial branch. Sullivan has “disregarded the constitutional imperative of a ‘case and controversy’ and the ‘separation of powers’ that invest the power to prosecute solely in the executive branch.” He has “no authority to adopt the role of prosecutor or change the issues in the case by inviting or appointing amici to perform the investigation or prosecution that the court deems appropriate.”Powell summarizes Sullivan’s errant behavior by using Chief Justice John Roberts’ well-known baseball analogy: ""This is an umpire who has decided to steal public attention from the players and focus it on himself. He wants to pitch, bat, run bases and play shortstop. In truth, he is way out in left field.”CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPowell not only asks the Court of Appeals to order Sullivan to dismiss the prosecution, but she also asks the court to assign another judge to the case for any final proceedings that may occur: “one who has not implied that [Flynn] is a traitor.”The interests of fundamental fairness and the objective, nonpartisan administration of justice favor the Court of Appeals granting both of those requests.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY HANS VON SPAKOVSKY"

"Over 4,300 virus patients sent to NY nursing homes, AP counts",New York,"Bernard Condon, _Jennifer Peltz, _Jim Mustian | Associated Press",2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.More than 4,300 recovering coronavirus patients were sent to New York’s already vulnerable nursing homes under a controversial state directive that was ultimately scrapped amid criticisms it was accelerating the nation’s deadliest outbreaks, according to a count by The Associated Press.AP compiled its own tally to find out how many COVID-19 patients were discharged from hospitals to nursing homes under the March 25 directive after New York’s Health Department declined to release its internal survey conducted two weeks ago. It says it is still verifying data that was incomplete.Whatever the full number, nursing home administrators, residents’ advocates and relatives say it has added up to a big and indefensible problem for facilities that even Gov. Andrew Cuomo — the main proponent of the policy — called “the optimum feeding ground for this virus.”Cuomo downplays calls for federal probe into nursing home coronavirus deaths: 'Ask President Trump'“It was the single dumbest decision anyone could make if they wanted to kill people,” Daniel Arbeeny said of the directive, which prompted him to pull his 88-year-old father out of a Brooklyn nursing home where more than 50 people have died. His father later died of COVID-19 at home.“This isn’t rocket science,” Arbeeny said. “We knew the most vulnerable -- the elderly and compromised -- are in nursing homes and rehab centers.”Told of the AP’s tally, the Health Department said late Thursday it “can’t comment on data we haven’t had a chance to review, particularly while we’re still validating our own comprehensive survey of nursing homes admission and re-admission data in the middle of responding to this global pandemic.”Cuomo, a Democrat, on May 10 reversed the directive, which had been intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged. But he continued to defend it this week, saying he didn’t believe it contributed to the more than 5,800 nursing and adult care facility deaths in New York — more than in any other state — and that homes should have spoken up if it was a problem.“Any nursing home could just say, ‘I can’t handle a COVID person in my facility,’” he said, although the March 25 order didn’t specify how homes could refuse, saying that ”no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the (nursing home) solely based” on confirmed or suspected COVID-19.Over a month later, on April 29, the Health Department clarified that homes should not take any new residents if they were unable to meet their needs, including a checklist of standards for coronavirus care and prevention.In the meantime, some nursing homes felt obligated and overwhelmed.Gurwin Jewish, a 460-bed home on Long Island, seemed well-prepared for the coronavirus in early March, with movable walls to seal off hallways for the infected. But after the state order, a trickle of recovering COVID-19 patients from local hospitals turned into a flood of 58 people.More walls were put up, but other residents nonetheless began falling sick and dying. In the end, 47 Gurwin residents died of confirmed or suspected COVID-19.The state order “put staff and residents at great risk,” CEO Stuart Almer said. “We can’t draw a straight line from bringing in someone positive to someone catching the disease, but we’re talking about elderly, fragile and vulnerable residents.”The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, known as AMDA, had warned from the beginning that Cuomo’s order admitting infected patients posed a “clear and present danger” to nursing home residents. Now, Jeffrey N. Nichols, who serves on the executive committee of the group, said “the effect of that order was to contribute to 5,000 deaths.”Nationally, over 35,500 people have died from coronavirus outbreaks at nursing homes and long-term care facilities, about a third of the overall death toll, according to the AP’s running tally.Cuomo has deflected criticism over the nursing home directive by saying it stemmed from Trump administration guidance. Still, few states went as far as New York and neighboring New Jersey, which has the second-most care home deaths, in discharging hospitalized coronavirus patients to nursing homes. California followed suit but loosened its requirement following intense criticism.Some states went in the opposite direction. Louisiana barred hospitals for 30 days from sending coronavirus patients to nursing homes with some exceptions. And while Louisiana reported about 1,000 coronavirus-related nursing home deaths, far fewer than New York, that was 40% of Louisiana’s statewide death toll, a higher proportion than in New York.New York’s Health Department told the AP May 8 it was not tracking how many recovering COVID-19 patients were taken into nursing homes under the order. But it was at that very moment surveying administrators of the state’s over 1,150 nursing homes and long-term care facilities on just that question.Those survey results have yet to be released. But regardless, the Health Department said, the survey had no bearing on Cuomo’s announcement May 10 that “we’re just not going to send a person who is positive to a nursing home after a hospital visit.”Cuomo said such patients would be accommodated elsewhere, such as sites originally set up as temporary hospitals.To some, the governor’s reversal came too late.CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE“It infected a great number of people in nursing homes who had no business getting infected, including short-term residents who were there for rehabilitation after surgeries,” said John Dalli, a New York attorney who specializes in nursing home cases.To be sure, incoming residents weren’t the only possible source of infection. Some homes believe a bigger contribution came from staffers and residents unaware they had the virus. And some say they would have taken on COVID-19 patients regardless of the state’s order.“There were nursing homes that realized that there was a void,” said Sarah Colomello, a spokeswoman for Thompson House in Rhinebeck. The 100-bed facility set up an isolated unit where affiliated hospitals nearby have sent at least 21 patients. It has reported no deaths.Cuomo administration officials say the original directive came when the governor feared the hospital system would be overwhelmed and was focused on creating as much hospital space as possible.That was welcomed by one of the many hospital systems and nursing homes surveyed for AP’s count. Northwell Health said three of its medical centers were so overtaxed at one point they had to put some ICU patients in hallways. To relieve pressure, the company eventually sent more than 1,700 COVID-19 patients to nursing homes.“Suffice it say, our hospitals were under stress,” spokesman Terence Lynam said."
Lorena Bobbitt on revisiting her notorious case in Lifetime film: 'There was a lot of trauma',Exclusive,Stephanie Nolasco,2020-05-22,"Lorena Bobbitt became a household name nearly 30 years ago when she finally snapped.On the night of June 23, 1993, after suffering years of abuse, the then-24-year-old cut off the penis of her sleeping husband John Wayne Bobbitt, 26, in small-town Manassas, Va.The shocking case, which quickly became the subject of late-night comedy skits, is now the subject of a Lifetime film titled “I Was Lorena Bobbitt,” which follows the now-49-year-old’s account leading up to that fateful day. Bobbitt served as executive producer and on-screen narrator.Lifetime will also run a PSA for the National Domestic Violence Hotline and the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence featuring Bobbitt, as well as Dani Montalvo and Like Humphrey, who star as the controversial couple. The move is part of the network’s public affairs campaign Stop Violence Against Women.DETECTIVE RECALLS MEETING ‘TRUCK STOP KILLER’ BRUCE MENDENHALL IN ‘DEADLY RECALL’: ‘THERE’S EVIL OUT THERE’'FAMILIES OF THE MAFIA' STAR KAREN GRAVANO EXPLAINS WHY DAD SAMMY ‘THE BULL’ IS APPEARING ON MTV REALITY SHOW“I think it’s really important that we are releasing this film now,” Montalvo, 26, who plays Bobbitt, told Fox News. “Now more than ever. I think people are listening. People are starting to realize, 'Hey, women -- they might be onto something. They might be telling the truth. They might all have this one, awful, horrible thing in common. And there’s something that we can do about it.'”“I hope that it... inspires people to reach out,” she continued. “And if they see the signs, they see the patterns of any sort of domestic or sexual violence that they can act. And I think by watching the movie, that they will see what it looks like to live with that sort of reality.”On that night, Bobbitt, a young immigrant who had nowhere to go, fled the scene, organ in hand. She drove off from their home and flung the penis out of the driver’s side window into a field.Police later went digging through the overgrown roadside grass for the missing member, The New York Times reported. They found it, put it on ice in a Big Bite hot dog box from a nearby 7-Eleven and then rushed it to the hospital for the bleeding spouse. The former Marine then underwent surgery for nearly 10 hours and had it reattached.KIM KARDASHIAN DETAILS HER NEW DOC, SAYS SHE'S NOT WORRIED ABOUT JUSTICE REFORM CRITICS‘FORGOTTEN WEST MEMPHIS THREE’ DOC AIMS TO GIVE VICTIMS OF NOTORIOUS CRIME 'THEIR VOICES BACK,’ HOST SAYSAt the time, a distraught Bobbitt claimed she was raped by her drunk husband and simply couldn’t take years of physical, sexual and emotional abuse anymore. But the notorious cause would go on to be sensationalized by tabloids and Bobbitt was depicted as a pop-culture punchline.At the time, martial rape only recently had been made a crime in all 50 states and was nearly impossible to prove in Virginia, The New York Times reported.“For some reason, the media was just infatuated about the cutting of this penis instead of what actually is the essence and the core of the story,” Bobbitt told Fox News. “The story was about domestic violence, domestic abuse, sexual assault… the media just missed this window of opportunity to tell [that].”“We have to understand that the media has a big platform to influence people’s opinion,” she said. “So whenever I see tabloids and it’s all about... penis this and penis that, it was like, ‘Wow, they’re really missing [the point].’ And in the movie… you’ll see I was very traumatized because his trial went first. And I really believed that I was going to prison. I was going to jail. The whole thing was based on something else. There [wasn’t] a focus on the real story.”PRINCE ANDREW ACCUSER VIRGINIA ROBERTS GIUFFRE TO STAR IN NETFLIX DOC ABOUT JEFFREY EPSTEINHARVEY WEINSTEIN ACCUSER CAITLIN DULANY RESPONDS TO SENTENCING: ‘I CAN NOW CELEBRATE A TRULY HISTORIC VICTORY’Bobbitt admitted it was difficult to see her turbulent past play out on set during filming.“It was very [traumatizing],” she said. “When I arrived on the scene, actually I was not able to see the sexual-assault scene because I arrived two days later. They just finished filming it. But there were a lot of emotions. There was a lot of trauma. And I knew I was going to get into it. I was prepared mentally because first of all, I helped with the script and I’m an executive producer. I knew exactly what was going on. And that helped me to actually prepare myself to know what I was going to expect. That was my story. I know my story the best.”The couple was initially charged in separate trials, Rolling Stone reported. For her, it was malicious wounding and for him, it was martial sexual assault. However, both were acquitted. Bobbitt, whose trial was televised by Court TV, successfully pleaded not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. They officially divorced in 1995.The Lifetime film isn’t the first time Bobbitt has come forward to shed new light on her story. Back in 2019, Amazon Studios released “Lorena,” a four-part docuseries that was executive produced by Jordan Peele.GREEN RIVER KILLER GARY RIDGWAY IS STILL HIDING MANY 'DARK SECRETS' DESPITE CONFESSION, SAYS PROSECUTOR IN DOCUMENTARYMISSING IOWA TV JOURNALIST JODI HUISENTRUIT'S FAMILY STILL SEARCHING YEARS LATER, DOC REVEALS: ‘IT'S HORRIBLE'While Bobbitt had avoided turning the high-profile take into a film or TV series of the year, she agreed to participate in the Amazon project in hopes of setting the record straight. Her ex-husband also agreed to participate, although the 53-year-old later claimed he was allegedly set up to be depicted as “a violent mean guy.”In a statement to Fox News, filmmaker Joshua Rofé said: “Lorena, John Wayne and more than 40 other witnesses, attorneys, jurors and experts were interviewed over the course of a year to give this docuseries a complete picture of events that took place. This is something Lorena Gallo was not afforded 25 years ago when the story was misconstrued and unfairly sensationalized in the public eye.”In the years since the trial, John Wayne was arrested several times and served jail for violence against two different women, according to The New York Times. He also denied those allegations.Over the years, Bobbitt has focused on launching the Lorena Gallo Foundation, which is dedicated to raising awareness on domestic violence and offering support to loved ones.EX-JEHOVAH’S WITNESS RECOUNTS SEXUAL ABUSE IN DOC, ORGANIZATION DENIES TRYING TO COVER IT UPLAS VEGAS SHOOTING SURVIVORS RECALL ‘CHAOS AND TURMOIL’ OF HORRIFIC NIGHT, MEETING RESCUER, IN NEW DOCUMENTARYBobbitt hopes that the film -- and her story -- will compel other women to speak out and not suffer in silence.“I’m glad I have a platform now,” she said. “I have a voice to talk and communicate what really happened and to be transparent, be raw. These are real issues. These are real victims. They’re suffering right now. And not only here in the United States, but around the world. [It] is affecting many, many people… And I want them to understand that there’s hope… Maybe they can escape domestic violence by saying, ‘Hey, you know what? This is what happened to me. And I’m not going to be such in this abusive situation. I have resources. I can get away. I can get out in the end.’”“If my story helps at least one person to escape domestic violence, then my mission is complete,” she added. “My suffering was not in vain.”“I Was Lorena Bobbit” premieres Monday, May 25, at 8 p.m. ET on Lifetime.If you or someone you know is suffering from abuse, please contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673."

"CNN obsesses over President Trump's mask aversion, ignores 'more important things': insider",Media,Joseph A. Wulfsohn,2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.CNN is being criticized for its wall-to-wall coverage of President Trump's mask-wearing, or lack thereof, while continuing to give short shrift to the New York nursing home coronavirus crisis presided over by one of its own anchors' brother.President Trump refused to wear a mask during the public portion of his visit to the Ford plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., on Thursday, despite the plant's strict policy on wearing masks and an open letter from Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel stating it was his ""legal responsibility” to wear one.A CNN insider told Fox News that while Trump should have worn the mask, the network is putting an undue emphasis on ""what's not important.""""I don't know why they focus on things like this when there are certainly more important things to focus on,"" the network source said.The insider knocked CNN, suggesting that if Trump found the cure for the coronavirus without wearing a mask, him not wearing the mask would become ""the story"" on the network.Trump had brought a mask to the Ford plant, which he wore during a private meeting with company executives, but not during the tour of the factory. “I didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,” Trump told reporters. “In the back area I did have a mask on. I had goggles and a mask right back there.”CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO DOES PROP COMEDY WITH NY GOV.

It's about the country,"" Cuomo told Trump. ""Great example of the president stepping on his own good headline. This was supposed to be about Ford and making ventilators and showing America how far we've come in that regard and how fast. Instead, he got caught up with the mask stuff and some other side issues.""""Nothing but excuses,"" Lemon complained. ""Some in this administration have forgotten that they work for the American people. This president certainly has forgotten. Nah — maybe he's never thought that he works for the American people.""The network's chief political anchor Jake Tapper also reacted. ""It seems like an odd thing to worry about given the fact that reporters have been relaying that health officials think it would be a great idea of all leaders across the country to wear them in public,"" he said. ""I don't know why he would not want that image out there.""GOV. ANDREW CUOMO GETS A PASS FROM CNN ON NURSING HOME POLICY CONTROVERSYCNN spent nearly 102 minutes on this issue on Thursday alone, dwarfing the roughly 15 minutes the network dedicated the entire week to a nursing home controversy surrounding Democratic New York Gov.

""If CNN were truly interested in fulfilling their duty in serving the public good and helping to build up a more informed citizenry, they would be grilling the Cuomo administration on their nursing home debacle... Instead, they're melting down over arguably the most-tested man in the world not wearing a mask.""Regarding the network's coronavirus coverage, Houck added, ""If a segment isn't focused on hating the president, decrying reopenings of any kind, or covering for China, it's not worth giving serious thought.""Cuomo recently reversed his March 25 order that forced nursing homes to accept patients who tested positive for coronavirus. Cuomo signed an executive order on May 11 stopping hospitals from sending infected patients back to nursing homes and ramping up testing for staff.More than 4,300 recovering coronavirus patients were sent to New York’s already vulnerable nursing homes under the state directive, according to a count by The Associated Press.Nearly 5,800 people have died from COVID-19 in nursing homes in New York. Roughly 20 percent of all deaths in the state have occurred in nursing homes.CUOMO BROTHERS' JOKEY CNN INTERVIEW IGNORING NURSING HOME CONTROVERSY SPARKS OUTRAGECuomo has largely gotten a pass from CNN as the liberal network has largely refrained from airing critical coverage of the Democratic governor. On Wednesday, he appeared for his tenth interview with his brother, ""Cuomo Prime Time"" anchor Chris Cuomo.As in previous interviews, the CNN anchor made no mention of the growing death toll in New York nursing homes. Yet, he did manage to squeeze in some prop comedy, mocking the governor's televised coronavirus testing examination with overly sized cotton swabs while poking fun at the size of his nose.There was only one mention of nursing homes during the entire interview, when Gov. Cuomo was boasting about the state's increased coronavirus testing capabilities and listed nursing homes and prisons among the sites that they have been administered.MSNBC'S STEPHANIE RUHLE SLAMMED FOR 'SOFTBALL INTERVIEW' WITH CUOMO AMID NURSING HOME CONTROVERSY""CNN's coverage of Andrew Cuomo has been consistent with much of the media, focus on the glowing verbiage and ignore the catastrophic mishandling of nursing homes that led to thousands of deaths,” Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson told Fox News.“This problem is compounded by a serious conflict of interest arising from the relationship between Chris Cuomo, one of CNN's highest-profile news personalities, and his brother the Governor,” Jacobson added. “Chris Cuomo should not be allowed to cover or comment on air about his brother, and CNN should appoint someone to monitor and review coverage of Andrew Cuomo to prevent this conflict of interest from bleeding over to other news coverage.”Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean told ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" Thursday that Cuomo's failed nursing home policy should be ""one of the biggest"" stories of the year after both of her parents-in-law lost their lives to the coronavirus.""I have not seen the coverage of this ... ,"" an emotional Dean said. ""Twenty percent of our lost loved ones are from nursing homes ... because Governor Cuomo and several other governors forced COVID-recovering patients into nursing homes.""CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGEDean, who rarely comments on political issues, felt compelled to speak out after watching Wednesday night's CNN interview between the two playful Cuomo brothers.""The fact that I am seeing, last night, him ... making fun, inappropriate jokes and insensitive jokes, cruel jokes ... make no mistake,"" Dean said, ""I am glad that Chris Cuomo has recovered from COVID because he apparently did have it.

Dems make big push to aid illegal immigrants amid coronavirus crisis,Illegal Immigrants,Adam Shaw,2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.Congressional Democrats and state governments are pushing a range of ways to assist illegal immigrants in their response to the coronavirus crisis, calling for the release of those in detention and lobbying to make them eligible for over a thousand dollars each in stimulus payments.President Trump, for his part, has responded to the crisis by cracking down on both illegal and legal immigration — slapping travel bans on China, Iran and the European Union and limiting entry on land borders to the north and south, while border officials are immediately returning illegal immigrants and asylum seekers to their home countries.HOUSE DEMOCRATS' CORONAVIRUS PACKAGE INCLUDES 'AMNESTY' FOR SOME ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, CRITICS SAYDemocrats, however, are taking the opposite approach. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., have introduced a bill that would release immigrants in detention into the country, and halt any immigration enforcement against anyone not deemed a “significant” threat to public safety.“We have an obligation to do everything we can to prevent the spread of this deadly disease, and that means moving people out of detention centers when they do not pose a public safety risk,” Booker said in a statement. “This is really a matter of life and death: it’s time that we act quickly and decisively to save as many lives as possible, and that means ending the unnecessary detention of immigrants during this public health crisis.”Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Democrats are demanding that the next round of stimulus checks include illegal immigrants by modifying a requirement that recipients have a Social Security number to receive one.DRUG CARTELS AT THE BORDER TRYING TO 'EXPLOIT' CORONAVIRUS CRISIS, CBP CHIEF SAYSA $3 trillion bill passed by the Democratic-controlled House last week would allow the $1,200 stimulus checks to go to those who also pay income taxes via an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) — which is used by people who are ineligible for a Social Security number, including illegal immigrants.As partial justification, Democrats have pointed to so-called mixed families, in which there are American citizens or legal permanent residents, as well as illegal immigrants, in one family. They file using an ITIN and so far have not been eligible for aid.“The Supreme Court ruled that children, undocumented children should have a right to education in our country. Why not then should citizens’ children, children in taxpayers’ families, not have the opportunity to the checks that they need?” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on a press call this month.But it’s an idea that has drawn strong criticism, even mockery, from Republicans who believe that aid should be reserved only to citizens and those here legally.“Can you believe it? We forgot to have the Treasury Department send money to people here illegally. My goodness. What an oversight,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor last week.The bill also included protections for “essential critical infrastructure workers” that would allow some illegal immigrants employed as such to be placed into “a period of deferred action” and be authorized to work if they meet certain conditions.It also grants protections to those employers who hire illegal immigrants, stating that “the hiring, employment or continued employment” of the defined group of illegal immigrants is not in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act.The move was flagged by Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli as a push by Democrats to grant ""amnesty"" to illegal immigrants and protection to those who employ them.“Is it really a good idea to not only grant an amnesty to illegal aliens but to absolve employers who have been breaking the law in the last few months?” he tweeted. “I don't think so!”SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL CALLS FOR $100 MILLION 'RELIEF FUND' FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTSMeanwhile, some state governments have been seeking to make sure illegal immigrants receive money and argue they should have been included in the last round of stimulus.The Seattle City Council is calling on Washington state to create a $100 million “relief fund” for illegal immigrants who did not qualify for the federal stimulus checks issued last month.The city’s council passed a resolution Monday asking Gov. Jay Inslee to create a “Washington Worker Relief Fund” to provide “economic assistance to undocumented Washingtonians during the COVID-19 pandemic.”Meanwhile in California, the state has opened up about $75 million for a fund to help roughly 150,000 illegal immigrants in the state. It gives them access to a coronavirus relief program that will pay $500 per person and up to $1,000 per household.The developments come as Democrats continue to shift left on immigration issues to the backdrop of the presidential race, drawing contrasts with Republicans who, along with the Trump administration, have advocated even tougher policies.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPDemocrats have opposed a host of Trump’s border security measures, including the wall at the southern border and the “Remain-in-Mexico” policy, while a number of top Democrats and presidential contenders have backed calls to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and to give health care and other social services to illegal immigrants.Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, meanwhile, has been on record calling for health care for illegal immigrants, as well as a 100-day moratorium on deportations if he wins the election in November."

Rep. Brian Mast: Memorial Day and my fallen friends show us how to thrive after coronavirus,OPINION,Rep. Brian Mast | Fox News,2020-05-21,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.The coronavirus pandemic has confronted our nation with many unique challenges. For the first time in our storied history, Americans were asked to not go to work, to not hustle and to not exhaust ourselves.Now, we are presented with an equal number of questions about how to move forward and re-open. How does America recover? How do we press forward? And how do we move on from the collapse of the routine that has always driven us on?I believe that Memorial Day can help provide the answer to these questions.MICHAEL LEVIN: AFTER CORONAVIRUS, HOW WILL YOU ANSWER THIS IMPORTANT QUESTION?Memorial Day gives us answers because we can reflect and seek spiritual guidance from the most selfless our country has ever known. We look to their grit. We ask ourselves what they would tell us to do and how would they ask us to revere the freedom they gave their last breath to provide.While they are no longer here to share what they learned in person, their stories leave us with lessons that are especially important in times where our country is challenged with adversity.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTEREach week when I fly into Washington, D.C., I see the beautiful white crosses and Stars of David of Arlington National Cemetery from above. When my young boys, Magnum and Maverick, are with me we tour the seemingly endless Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the larger-than-life steel statues of the Korean War Memorial, or the expansive World War II Memorial. In my opinion, there are none from whom we can learn more than these heroes who gave it all so that we may live free.Gracing the walls of the building that houses my office are the names of each fallen brother and sister from my war. Each day, as I pass through the entrance, I see the faces of those I knew, and each time my eye catches a heading for all lost in a given month and year my mind replays conversations had with so many fallen friends.The etching of their names reminds us of their commitment to the fight and the way nothing would ever stop them.Every time, I wonder if we are worthy of their sacrifice. Just as each soldier strives to prove themselves each day of service, I believe my fallen friends would want each civilian to strive to prove themselves each day of free life. In that, I believe, lies the answer to how our country recovers from this crisis.So, this Memorial Day, I am reflecting on the sacrifice of my friends — that I served with, took fire with, climbed mountains in Afghanistan with, disarmed bombs with and took it to America’s enemies with — and the lessons we can learn from them:Americans are never victims. If we wake up under the flag they charged into battle with then we wake up getting to decide that today will be a better day than yesterday and that this week will be better than last week.I believe Staff Sgt. Eric Trueblood (KIA 03/10/2011) would remind us that we are not measured by what we do when something is a walk in the park. Rather, we get measured when we face something that seems impossible.I believe Staff Sgt. David Day (KIA 04/24/2011) would tell us that the tougher the times, the tougher the people get built.Sgt. Justin Allen (KIA 07/18/2010) was never one to feel sorry for himself, so I believe he would take on the challenge with everything he’s got — not once complaining.Sgt. Anibal Santiago (KIA 07/18/2010) would probably challenge everybody — in language that isn’t fit to print — to have the courage to get out and live their lives.I believe Senior Chief Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician Craig Vickers (KIA 08/06/2011) would remind us—in excruciating detail—that, no matter what we do, every minute still has 60 seconds, each hour still has 60 minutes and each day is still going to take 24 of those. We shouldn’t let time pass us by trying to evade life’s challenges.I believe Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician Second Class Petty Officer Tyler Trahan (KIA 04/01/2009) would keep it simple: keep going no matter what, he might say.I believe Capt. Kyle Comfort (KIA 05/08/2010) would remind us that even knowing every possible detail about the coronavirus that there is to know, there is still going to be risk.I believe Doc Jonathan Peney (KIA 06/01/2010) would tell us that not even training to be safe is safe.I believe Sgt. Tanner Higgins (KIA 04/14/2012) would tell us not to waste a moment of this precious life that we have the privilege to live.I believe Sgt. Andrew Nicol (KIA 08/08/2010) would probably say that he didn’t live in tents, cargo ship containers, mud huts and swamps so the people he fought for can curl up and hide.Finally, I believe Sgt. 1st Class Lance Vogeler (KIA 10/01/2010) — one of my closest friends and who I would undoubtedly turn to for advice if he were still here — would share with me a couple lessons. Seek the positive in the negative, he would say. Commitment to life is not about the quantity of minutes we get but about the way we spend the minutes we have and how we effect those in our path.A massive quantity of his minutes were spent in combat fighting for us. He was killed during his 12th deployment, just days after I was taken off the battlefield by an improvised explosive device.Each Memorial Day I am given a renewed commitment to honor his sacrifice and the sacrifice of all those who were laid to rest beneath our beautiful flag of 50 stars and 13 red and white stripes. This Memorial Day, they all remind me that we are not made of glass and we don’t just break when we fall.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPI hope our nation can learn from them. We have been challenged by COVID-19, but Americans are never victims. If we wake up under the flag they charged into battle with then we wake up getting to decide that today will be a better day than yesterday and that this week will be better than last week. If we do not actively work to make it that way then we squander the life and freedom they gave everything to defend.So, for those honored by the slow hum of Taps, I pray that this Memorial Day the crack of their 21-gun salute can be so jarring that it wakes up the world.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP.

Some were found on the surface of the water, while others inside the boat's hull, or on the ocean floor after it capsized.A number of the victim's families have since filed wrongful-death claims against the Santa Barbara-based operator of the vessel, Truth Aquatics, which is owned by Glen and Dana Fritzler, according to the Santa Barbara Independent.CALIFORNIA DIVE BOAT IN LABOR DAY FIRE WAS EXEMPT FROM COAST GUARD SAFETY REGULATIONS: REPORTIn 1996, the Coast Guard implemented a set of standards on new vessels, requiring escape hatches at least 32 inches wide and illuminated exit signs. The 75-foot vessel, built-in 1981, had a 24-inch hatch and no illuminated signsAn official from the National Transportation Safety Board remarked how difficult it was to reach an escape hatch in the bunk room, which was a design that routinely met regulations. The boat reportedly passed its two most recent safety inspections, according to Coast Guard records.The survivors said they woke to find the boat in flames. They were unable to reach the sleeping passengers and had to jump in the water to save their own lives.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPRaney told The Associated Press the coroner’s office did not do internal autopsies of the bodies. He said external examinations of the victims and black soot in their trachea, as well as toxicology tests, showed enough evidence of smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning to avoid autopsies.Fox News' Frank Miles and the Associated Press contributed to this report"
'Terror-related' shooting at NAS Corpus Christi prompts search for possible 2nd suspect,Manhunt,Dom Calicchio,2020-05-22,"A manhunt was underway in Texas for a possible second suspect after a Thursday shooting at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas that was “terror-related.”“We may have a potential second related person of interest at large in the community,” Leah Greeves, an FBI supervisory senior resident, told reporters, according to KRIS-TV of Corpus Christi.In a series of Twitter messages late Thursday, the FBI’s Houston office called on the public to share any information they may have about the NAS Corpus Christi incident.NAVAL AIR STATION CORPUS CHRISTI SHOOTING INVESTIGATED AS 'TERRORISM-RELATED,' FBI REPORTS“We are not ruling out any possible motives and continue to investigate all leads,” the FBI said in a post. “When we are able to release additional information, we will do so.”A gunman described as an “Arab male” and later identified by The Associated Press as Adam Alsahli of Corpus Christi was killed in a gunbattle with law enforcement at the station, located along the Gulf of Mexico, about 229 miles southwest of Houston.Authorities say the suspect tried to speed his vehicle through a security gate at the naval facility around 6:15 a.m. Thursday but was stopped by a guard who managed to put up a barrier in time to block the driver’s access.A female security officer was shot in the chest during an exchange of gunfire with the suspect, but she was wearing body armor and survived with only minor injuries, KRIS reported.Other security personnel soon arrived and fatally shot the suspect, the AP reported.Following that gunbattle, local police SWAT officers and FBI agents surrounded a home in Corpus Christi. A public records search by KRIS revealed the location to be Alsahli’s last known home address.But authorities would not confirm whether the operation was related to the incident at NAS Corpus Christi, the Caller Times of Corpus Christi reported.After the shooting, the naval air station was on lockdown for about five hours as authorities conducted their investigation.At a news conference, Greeves declared the incident “terror-related,” but provided no details on how investigators reached that conclusion.“We are working diligently with our state, local and federal partners on this investigation, which is fluid and evolving,” Greeves said.Attorney General William Barr has been briefed on the matter, a Justice Department spokesman told the AP.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPA similar lockdown occurred at NAS Corpus Christi last December after a suspect with a stolen firearm rammed a truck into a barricade there. The suspect later pleaded guilty to destruction of U.S. government property.Thursday’s incident also follows a Dec. 6 shooting at NAS Pensacola in Florida that left three U.S. sailors dead and eight other people wounded. The suspect in that case, who had been in contact with al-Qaeda operatives, was killed by a sheriff’s deputy.The Associated Press contributed to this story."

Food and milk giveaways draw long lines. Some people have gone two months without money because of the state’s problem-plagued online unemployment benefits portal.“We’re making decisions based on the best information we have, and making the best decisions we can, based on the best models that are always changing and moving,"" Wolf said, according to PennLive.com.The state is reportedly taking a county-centric approach. The PennLive report said 37 of the state’s 67 counties are in the yellow stage, which essentially means caution and mitigation. Eighteen counties are red, which means a stay-at-home order is in place.President Trump recently talked about the state’s lockdown and said Pennsylvanians “want their freedom now.”The paper reported that Wolf’s response to the coronavirus has been praised and “Democrats aren’t exactly defecting” but there is some pressure. The paper reported that 16 Senate Democrats signed a letter recently for the governor’s office to consider permitting non-“life-sustaining” stores for curbside pickup.“The truth of the matter is we do need to start thinking about getting people back to work,"" State Sen. Steve Santarsiero, a Democrat, said. ""I really think we’re getting very close to that point. Curbside pickup is part of that question.

Iran picks cyber fight with Israel as both sides target critical infrastructure,TECH,Hollie McKay,2020-05-22,"The simmering cyber conflict between Iran and Israel reached a boiling point this week as the two enemies have been going tit-for-tat in an effort to quietly take down critical infrastructure that security analysts dub something of an electronic cold war.“The fact that Iran is behaving so aggressively, and trying to disrupt critical services in Israel, is very disturbing,” David Kennedy, founder/CEO of TrustedSec, and a former hacker for the NSA and U.S. Marine Corps told Fox News. “Any time you have a state actor engaged in industrial sabotage, that is a real cause for concern. When you attack a critical service like water, power, hospitals, or transportation, you are essentially putting lives at risk.”Last month, Iran fired the first shot by purporting to cyberattack water installations – including tanks, pumps, and pipelines in Israel – raising the alarm among national security and cyber experts over the vulnerability of critical infrastructure.While some slight damage to water valves and control systems did take place, according to Haaretz, ultimately there was no persistent damage to the water supply as the hackers had likely intended.IRAN FACES FURTHER ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION IN CORONAVIRUS FALLOUTAnd then on May 9, the Bandar Abbas port terminal in the south of Iran was suddenly crippled, and shipping traffic was suspended for days. Israel was behind the retaliatory strike back which successfully inflicted severe damage without causing casualties, the Washington Post reported this week.Israeli Water Authority officials reportedly detected the attempt and immediately changed system passwords and took measures to secure their systems.“It is definitely unusual to see a state actor targeting the critical infrastructure assets of another state. That type of activity is usually reserved for war or near-war situations, at least by most countries,” Kennedy surmised. “Iran doesn’t respect those rules.”Moreover, analysts have also pointed out that Iran’s cyberattack was executed through servers based in the United States and Europe, which indicates some degree of sophistication, despite being a routine TACTIC used globally by those adverse to the West.“The Israeli response was measured yet enough to cause logistical and economic disorder from Iran’s main port at a time when they can ill afford any further financial disruptions due to sanctions, low oil prices, unemployment, and massive inflation,” noted Jeff Bardin, the Chief Intelligence Officer at security firm Treadstone 71. “My assumption here is that the Iranians used extracts and updates to Stuxnet code to manipulate the Israeli equipment.”The Stuxnet virus was a joint cyber operation between Israeli and American intelligence and was deployed in 2011 to infect Iran’s then-burgeoning nuclear program – effectively harming the electricity boxes linked to the centrifuges being utilized for uranium enrichment. Nonetheless, Tehran was able to course correct in the aftermath of the course contagion, learning how to bolster its own cyber defense and develop tactics of its own.And following the April attempt to harm Israel’s water systems, the regime is said to have overinflated the outcome in its press as a means of distraction against the coronavirus pandemic crippling much of the nation’s health care system. The gloating prompted Israel to acknowledge that an incident had happened, although it was largely dismissed.“We are in a state of constant cyber cold war accentuated by regular skirmishes such as the Iranian attack on Israeli water systems and the Israeli response on Iran’s main port. Israel does not usually come out of the shadows to execute publicly identified cyber-attacks,” Bardin continued. “They did so this time since Iran was chest-thumping over the attack on the Israeli water system, considered critical infrastructure. Israel had to strike back and did so in such a way that shut down the port for 10 days.”And Kennedy further underscored that because Iran does not have the military might to confront Israel or the United States directly, it is instead forced to engage in asymmetric warfare, of which cyber is an important part.“Ever since Iran was hit by Stuxnet, they have been actively developing their own cyber-kinetic capabilities. This capability is extremely important for Iran because it gives them the ability to strike inside the borders of countries that they could not attack directly with traditional military forces. It also allows them to score PR victories at home, without risking a humiliating military response,” he said. “Iran’s cyber operations against Israel are definitely becoming more aggressive during the pandemic. Anytime you target critical infrastructure, you are seriously escalating the situation.”HOW ISIS IS EXPLOITING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMICAnd things kicked up an extra notch on Thursday, after allegedly Iran-based hackers seemingly infiltrated tens of thousands of unsecured Israeli websites, disabling their functions and blasting threatening videos and messages pertaining to the “crimes against the Palestinians,” and “all we can do is revenge from a cyberattack.”The group remains on both Facebook and Youtube.“Thousands of Israeli sites, including sites of major and major companies in the economy, were vandalized following an attack by anti-Israel officials against the Upress hosting company,” Bardin explained. “The attack disrupted the company’s servers. Instead of the usual content of the sites appears content calling for the destruction of Israel. In addition, the sites ask the users permission to use the camera to take photos.”He pointed out that, at this stage, it is unclear whether the company’s databases were hacked or is it merely a corruption. Upress, one of Israel’s largest website hosting companies, announced on its Facebook page that the attack was caused by security vulnerabilities in the WordPress plugin. “We work in collaboration with the state cyber authority, conduct security investigations, and handle all sites,” the company added. Hacking a web hosting company allows hackers to hit many sites at once.CORONAVIRUS CRISIS: ONLINE CHURCH SERVICES ATTACKED BY HACKERS USING CHILD PORNOGRAPHYIn addition, Bardin’s Treadstone 71 found significant chatter in Iranian social media sites on WordPress vulnerabilities prior to the penetration.But where the Iran/Israel cyber conflict goes from here – and whether tensions will continue to rise – remains to be seen. According to Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow and Iran expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), the use of cyber tools for purposes of damage and espionage is consistent with Iran’s asymmetric military strategy.“Just like proxy wars, the cyber domain permits Iran to mask its hand and involvement, as well as limit the potential for kinetic blowback and escalation,” he explained. “In this regard, Iran’s cyber wars have been successful, even if they invite Israel or other states to respond to Iranian aggression using The same or better cyber means.”CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSome experts have also asserted that Iran’s reignition of the quiet fight with Israel last month was in response to Israel’s frequent targeting of Iran-backed, Hezbollah assets in Syria.“(The cyber conflict) will not end anytime soon. The cyberattack that Iran launched on Israel's water infrastructure was a convenient and relatively low-risk way to retaliate against recent (presumed) Israeli strikes on Iranian targets in Syria,” added Heather Heldman, managing partner of Luminae Group and a former Middle East advisor at the US State Department. “Regardless of the fact that Iran's cyberattack failed to cause significant damage or disruption inside Israel, it gave the Iranian regime an opportunity to score points with its domestic audience and distract from the turmoil transpiring at home, which has intensified in the wake of Coronavirus and low oil prices.”"
Teen left orphaned after murder-suicide earns $120G college scholarship through golf caddying,Proud American,Michael Ruiz,2020-05-22,"An Ohio teen who was left orphaned after a murder-suicide eight years ago has earned herself a full college scholarship to attend The Ohio State University through hard work in the classroom -- and as a caddy on the golf course.Caroline Jarrell was 10 years old and watching the Disney Channel when she heard four gunshots ring out into the night outside her father’s home.It was 8:04 p.m. on Jan. 10, 2012 -- a time she said has always stuck in her mind.Her parents were divorced. And her mother had arrived to pick up the children from a stay with their father, she told Fox News.Caroline was the first of her siblings to venture out after the noise. She found their mother’s body in the driveway, in her car with the family dog. Her father was dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound nearby.“I didn’t know what was going on,” she said Thursday. “I just knew that something bad had happened.”She remembers seeing blood, trying to talk to her mom, and a neighbor calling 911. Much of the rest of the night condensed into a blur.“It was just chaotic for everyone,” she said.Her grandparents, Dennis and Linda Pawlecki, as well as her mother’s brother Michael Pawlecki, drove over an hour that night to be with the children.“They were really helpful that night,” Jarrell said. “They helped calm me down, even though they were going through everything.”The Jarrell children stayed in their mother’s house the rest of that school year, with frequent visits from the Pawleckis. Then they moved in with their grandparents in Toledo, Ohio.Next semester, Jarrell is headed to The Ohio State University on a full ride thanks to the Evans Scholars Foundation, named for Charles “Chick” Evans Jr., a famed amateur golfer who set up the program with the Western Golf Association in 1930.Nick, the oldest of the Jarrell children, had already been caddying before they came to Ohio, at his mother’s urging. It was in an effort to earn that same scholarship.In Toledo, one of the first things he did was find a new caddying job at the famed Inverness Club, Caroline said. He eventually received the Evans Scholarship and went to The Ohio State University. Now he’s an English teacher in Cincinnati.Ellyn Jarrell, the middle child, earned herself her own Evans Scholarship -- and she’s still attending the University of Notre Dame, where their mother went to college.Following in the footsteps of her older siblings, Caroline started caddying at Inverness in the summer after eighth grade. She said it’s the only job she’s ever had.Now, she’s also achieved the Evans Scholarship.Working at Inverness, she met her future Ohio State roommate, Kelcy -- who is yet another Evans recipient.The Evans Scholarship covers full tuition and housing costs for “high-achieving caddies with limited financial means,” according to the foundation. That amounts to an estimated $120,000 per recipient. The Evans Scholars Program says it has paid out $410 million in scholarships overall.The scholarships receive financial support from tens of thousands of Par Club donors, as well as the WGA’s BMW Championship, which is a PGA Tour FedEx Cup playoff event.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPRecipients show good grades, financial need, “outstanding character” and a strong caddie record.At Ohio State, Caroline said she will study social work -- a career path she chose because of the social worker who helped her keep it together when she dealt her parents’ divorce as a child.“She was the first person who, besides my mom and my siblings, who just made me feel heard,” Jarrell said Thursday. “I just wanted to be that person for someone else, to help them feel like they’re not alone.”"

""We invite you, your families and friends to join us, virtually, in honoring our fallen service members and their families’ sacrifice.""“wear blue” is a nonprofit running community honoring the service and sacrifice of the American military. The community “unites and supports military and their families, veterans, Gold Star families, and civilians through active remembrance and meaningful relationships.” The organization works to act as a support network, serve as a living memorial and bridge the gap between military and civilian communities.“wear blue is virtual for Memorial Day,” Hallett told Fox News. ""We have intentionally partnered with Team Red White and Blue and other like minded organizations to build a robust, and united effort to honor the fallen and support the military during this time of separation.”Hallett told Fox News that “wear blue” and Team RWB are “calling on our nation to come together in shared steps outside of our back doors.”“Our goal is 50,000 runners committed to running or walking in honor of the fallen,” Hallett said, noting that the organization has also partnered with Amazon, VISA and more to make the event happen. “We recognize that now, more than ever, we are stronger together.”Hallett told Fox News that “Amazon and its 25,000 military veterans joined 'wear blue' in creating a virtual training program as part of a stay healthy-stay connected campaign that we developed together.”“Amazon employees have been sharing their weekly training and preparing to run a 5k this Memorial Day,” Hallett told Fox News. “We are excited to partner with them, and grateful for their generous support of our programming.”A spokesperson for Amazon confirmed to Fox News the company's involvement.Hallett added that VISA also had a military and veteran network and “is joining us in running this Memorial Day.”This Memorial Day, Hallett invited runners, walkers and supporters to download the “Motigo” app, which will feature messages from families of the fallen, and fellow service members, sharing stories about their loved ones and what Memorial Day means to them.Participation is at no cost, Hallett told Fox News, saying that runners, walkers and supporters “simply commit a meaningful number of miles to run or walk or move on Memorial Day.”“On Memorial Day, we ask that our community shares their honored hero with others on their social media channels, with the challenge, for the examples and motivation of these heroes to live in how we live,” Hallett said.Meanwhile, in 2017, “wear blue” launched a program dedicated to Gold Star children called the “wear blue Gold Star Youth Mentorship Program,” which pairs active duty military with children of fallen service members.This year, Gold Star children, with the support of the USAA Foundation, have been training virtually to run a Memorial Day 5K.“Each week, we join a Zoom call, and discuss training tips and setting and achieving smart goals,” Hallett told Fox News. “They are running for purposeful steps on Memorial Day in honor of their fallen parents.”Hallett explained that on Memorial Day, runners will be invited to join a “Zoom Circle of Remembrance,” and then will begin to walk or run in honor of their fallen hero.AMERICA TOGETHER: MORE STORIES OF THE AMERICAN SPIRIT“I am proud of 'wear blue: run to remember' and Team RWB, as we join our communities in a nationwide effort to honor and remember our fallen military heroes on this Memorial Day,” Hallett told Fox News. “On Monday, May 25, we will speak the names and share the stories of the men and women who volunteered to serve their countries and gave the last full measure in doing so. And in this act, we are reminded of our potential and our call to rise.”“wear blue” originally was founded following the redeployment of 5-2 Stryker Brigade Combat Team, a unit that, while deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, sustained a significant amount of combat losses and casualties. During that deployment, a small group of 5-2 wives and battalion support staff met weekly to run, seeking to create a support network for one another. When the brigade returned, Hallett, and co-founder, Erin O’Connor, turned the small group into a nationwide vision.Hallett told Fox News that the program has had a very personal impact on her family. Her husband, Capt. John Hallett, was killed on Aug. 25, 2009, just three weeks after the birth of their third child, Heidi, and just six weeks after his deployment with 5th Stryker Brigade to Shah Wali Kot district in Kandahar. Capt. Hallett was killed when his unit encountered an improvised explosive device.“It’s been over 10 years since my husband Capt. John Hallett was killed in combat. Our three children are growing up … they are anxious to hear the stories of the young adult they are striving to become — stories of John that often feel too far away,” Hallett explained.“In military service, there is not always the space to tell the stories of our fallen friends and leaders,” she continued. “As community members, there are not always words strong enough to say thank you, or I am sorry for your loss. But on Memorial Day, our steps become the words and the stories.”Hallett added that as her children grow up “it’s bittersweet to see John on their faces and in their actions, as well as their own desires to know the man they barely met.”CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP“I’m grateful for this day that we share with our country our pride,” she said. “And they share with us their strength and remembrance.”“When I look at the streets across America, and I witness a nation moving in red, white and blue, I know that you remember.

Sign up here.The Michigan Court of Claims ruled Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has the authority to keep her state under a state of emergency without legislative approval, after GOP lawmakers challenged her extension of sweeping restrictions.Republicans in the House and Senate were frustrated with Whitmer’s one-size strategy to stop the spread of coronavirus by keeping people home and shutting businesses in regions minimally affected by the virus and far from the state’s epicenter, the Detroit area.The legislature did not approve the extension of Whitmer’s emergency declaration but she enacted it anyway, extending the stay-at-home order until May 28 but loosening some restrictions. On May 18, Whitmer allowed retail businesses, bars and restaurants in two regions to open at a limited capacity.And while gatherings are discouraged, groups of 10 or fewer will not be cited for gathering.The judge said a 1945 law, cited by Whitmer, is not limited to local and regional emergencies only but can be used on a statewide level.MICHIGAN BARBERS, HAIRDRESSERS GIVE FREE HAIRCUTS AT CAPITOL IN DEFIANCE OF WHITMER'S LOCKDOWNThe legislature said Whitmer violated the law, which says lawmakers get a role in emergency declarations lasting longer than 28 days. Indeed, the judge said the governor can't use that law to extend emergencies without input from lawmakers. But Whitmer won the case anyway.“It would take a particularly strained reading of the plain text of the [law] to conclude that a grant of authority to deal with a public crisis that affects all the people of this state would somehow be constrained to a certain locality,” Judge Cynthia Stephens said.The claims are “meritless,” she said.Stephens' decision was a third time that a Court of Claims judge ruled in the governor's favor. The other lawsuits were brought by residents, a business owner and a new group that has organized protests at the Capitol.CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGEThe House and Senate promised to appeal the ruling. Republican leaders took some comfort that the judge said Whitmer can't use the '76 law to unilaterally make emergency declarations.The governor’s office responded postiviely to the result.“She will continue to do what she’s always done: take careful, decisive actions to protect Michiganders from this unprecedented, global pandemic,” Whitmer's office said in a written statement.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
Tokyo Olympics followed up by 3 mega-events -- all in China,Olympics,,2020-05-22,"Uncertainty grips next year’s postponed Tokyo Olympics: Will there be fans or empty stadiums in 14 months? And how will thousands of athletes, staff, and technical officials travel, be housed, and stay safe amid COVID-19?And Tokyo is not alone.China — where the COVID-19 outbreak was first detected — will hold three mega-sports events within a year after Tokyo is set to close.CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COMThe World University Games in Chengdu in western China open 10 days after the Tokyo Games close, with up to 8,000 athletes. Next come the Beijing Winter Olympics beginning on Feb. 4, 2022, and the Asian Games in Hangzhou starting on Sept. 10. The previous edition of the Asian Games in Indonesia drew 11,000 athletes and featured more sports than the Olympics.A fourth major event, soccer’s 24-team Club World Championship, was to open in China in June of 2021, but has been postponed because of scheduling conflicts created by the pandemic.China is a go-to country for these mega events, through expertise gained from the 2008 Beijing Olympics and because it absorbs the massive costs. It spent at least $40 billion to organize the 2008 Olympics, and there was no national debate since the authoritarian state prohibits voting or referendums.Voters in Europe and North America have repeatedly said “no” to referendums to hold the games. China landed the 2022 Winter Olympics when several European bidders withdrew. Beijing won narrowly in a vote by the IOC against Almaty, Kazakhstan.“Telling the citizens of Bavaria or Switzerland that another Winter Olympics would benefit them greatly doesn’t work,” Jonathan Grix, who studies sports policy at Manchester Metropolitan University, wrote in an email. He said voters sense that “citizens rarely benefit the most from such events.”“Authoritarian states have no need to ask the populace, they have no need to compromise on policy, there is no political opposition (by definition) and most delivery services are state-run, ensuring the smooth running of the event,“ Grix added.Japanese and International Olympic Committee officials have given few details about how the Tokyo Olympics will be staged, the cost of postponement, and who will pay for it. They’ve teased the problems and floated tenuous solutions. They’ve agreed on one thing: If the games can’t open on July 23, 2021, they’ll be canceled.In a joint news conference last weekend, the director general of the World Health Organization cautioned it would not be “easy” to make the Olympics a safe global gathering spot.But Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed confidence: “I think it’s possible,”IOC President Thomas Bach has been cautious in speculating how the Olympics can be held. He’s suggested a possible quarantine for athletes, hinted at limited fan access to venues, and has not ruled out events in empty stadiums. Of course, he says that’s not his preference.IOC member John Coates, who oversees preparations for Tokyo, has been direct.“We’ve got real problems because we’ve got athletes having to come from 206 different nations,” Coates said, speaking at a News Corp Australia digital forum and reported in The Australian newspaper. “We’ve got 11,000 athletes coming, 5,000 technical officials and coaches, 20,000 media."" There's also about 4,000 working on the organizing committee and an expected 60,000 volunteers.""Some scientists in Japan and elsewhere believe a vaccine is needed to guarantee safety for athletes. But some have asked if young, healthy athletes should be a priority for vaccination.The biggest challenge might be guaranteeing the safety of fans who have already bought millions of tickets. If there are no fans, will there be refunds? Will there be lawsuits? Tickets provide at least $800 million income for local organizers with the added cost of postponement estimated in Japan at $2 billion to $6 billion.Eric Saintrond, the CEO of the FISU — the Switzerland-based governing body of the World University Games — said in an email to The Associated Press that decisions related to “security and health will be taken” by the Chinese government. He said final decisions in this area do “not in fact rest with FISU.” He said all preparations were “on track.”University Games spokesman Wang Guangliang was asked about housing for athletes, fans, and so forth, but offered little clarity, deflecting back to the FISU.“The impact of the pandemic is still unforeseeable and we are still studying the situation and need to discuss with FISU about what to do to reduce the impact and ensure the safety of all participants,” Wang wrote in a email to the AP.Postponing the Summer Olympics by a year has raised questions about marketing the Winter Olympics, which open six months after Tokyo closes. Construction is on schedule, but sponsors may face challenges.“Sponsors and business partners of the games will have to keep investing extra money in their marketing programs for Tokyo if the games are postponed, potentially forcing them to reduce their budgets for the next Olympics,” Wei Jizhong, a former secretary general of the Chinese Olympic Committee, told the China Daily.The Associated Press emailed questions about Beijing 2022 preparations to Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC vice president who oversees Beijing preparations. He did not immediately reply to the request, nor to a follow-up. Beijing could also face the issues of athlete quarantines, fewer fans, and the fear of spreading the virus even more.In an interview in February with China’s official Xinhua News Agency, Samaranch was laudatory about preparations. He praised Beijing organizers, President Xi Jinping, who heads of the Chinese Communist Party, and China’s handling of the virus.Sheena Greitens, who studies Asian politics at the University of Texas at Austin, said large sports events give China high visibility and “can keep reporters focused on the sporting events rather than having them use their time in-country to dig around on other topics that might reflect poorly on the CCP (Chinese Communist Party).”“They provide a way for China to boost its cultural and ‘discourse power’ globally,” Greitens wrote in an email. “And they do so in a forum that generally emphasizes international cooperation and is weighted away from the serious disagreements that many countries have with China over territorial conflict, human rights, and trade, among other topics.”"

Some restaurants pushing back against third-party delivery apps,Restaurants,Alexandra Deabler,2020-05-22,"Restaurants across the country are pushing back against third-party delivery apps as more Americans turn to their services during the COVID-19 crisis when establishments have been forced to close dining rooms and focus only on takeaway options.Owners are struggling to keep restaurants open amid the pandemic, which has forced them to change hours, lay off employees and, in some cases, increase prices just to stay afloat. Now some of these stressed restaurants say third-party delivery apps such as Grubhub, DoorDash and Uber Eats are causing even more economic issues. But those providers say they are on the restaurants' side, and couldn't exist without them.APPLEBEE'S, CHUCK E. CHEESE OPERATE UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES ON DELIVERY APPSAccording to these business owners, restaurants are left with a fraction of their earnings after third-party apps collect their ""exorbitant"" fees. Some, such as DoorDash, have also been accused of misleading consumers without consent from the restaurant owners, hijacking their Google listings and placing itself as the restaurant’s preferred delivery option.Restaurant owner John Stamos of Pitas and Sticks in Brooklyn, N.Y., began placing a note inside each delivery bag to its customers, describing Grubhub's commission fees.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER""Small businesses like us need your support in this time of crisis,"" Stamos writes in each note. ""Online apps such as GRUBHUB ARE CHARGING US 30% of each order and $9 or more on orders made using phone numbers on their app or website … please help save the restaurant industry by ordering directly with us,” the note read, NBC News reported.Restaurants are pleading with their customers to order directly from their business pages instead of turning to the convenience of delivery apps. Some have even begun offering special deals available to those that order from them directly.Chain restaurant Bareburger started advertising its specials “only available on bareburger.com.” It also placed signage urging people to “support your local restaurants & order directly with them,” according to the outlet.FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWSMesa Pizza Co. also took out ads slamming Grubhub and asking customers to call them directly.“When the delivery platform takes 30 percent, it means almost all restaurants that are using the delivery platforms are running at break-even or actually at a loss for every time you place an order.” — Travis Stoliker, co-owner of Saddleback BBQ“How it works is the delivery platforms come into a market, and they usually start by putting all of the restaurants’ menus on their platforms,” Travis Stoliker, co-owner of Saddleback BBQ in Lansing, Mich., told the Lansing State Journal. ""They basically scrape the Internet, find our menus and they list us and they create essentially websites that are about our restaurant. And they haven’t gotten permission to do that.""“When the delivery platform takes 30 percent, it means almost all restaurants that are using the delivery platforms are running at break-even or actually at a loss for every time you place an order,"" Stoliker added.Grubhub denies the allegations, instead blaming high rent and taxes -- not Grubhub's commission fees, which it says are used for delivery costs and marketing.""Grubhub is neither a public utility nor simply a delivery service. In the simplest of terms, Grubhub is a marketing engine and an order generation business -- connecting hungry diners to great, local restaurants,"" a spokesperson for Grubhub said in a statement to Fox News.""The platform is free for any restaurant owner who chooses to join, and Grubhub offers a fee-for-service model, meaning that restaurant owners select the services they want and only pay when Grubhub generates a sale. Restaurants have many options to drive business besides third-party marketplaces, none of which are seeing their fees regulated.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPCities have moved to cap fees that delivery companies can charge. DoorDash even cut its commission fees in half, and Uber Eats says it stopped charging delivery fees for more than 100,000 independent restaurants in an effort to help.The caps, which have been implemented in several cities across the U.S., have been vehemently opposed by Grubhub, claiming they would hinder restaurants' earnings.""On the face of it, a cap on fees seems to be an easy solution to help restaurants that are struggling due to the coronavirus. And there is nothing we want more than to ensure the health of independent restaurants -- we don’t have a business without them,"" the statement read.""But this solution is exactly the wrong thing to do. In reality, this proposed cap will lower order volume to locally-owned restaurants, increase costs -- and headaches -- for small business owners, and raise costs to customers. Delivery workers, who are currently relying on Grubhub to earn an income including 100 percent of tips from diners, would have fewer work opportunities and lower earnings. In the middle of what is quickly becoming one of the worst economic downturns in a century, Grubhub is ensuring that workers in New York City can continue to provide for themselves and their families.""A spokesperson for DoorDash did not respond to requests for comment."
RNC Chair McDaniel: Democrats and voter fraud in Nevada — here's how it will impact you,OPINION,Ronna McDaniel,2020-05-22,"Democrats say they want more “inclusive” voting practices. They fail to mention just how inclusive their plans are: sending ballots to dead voters.Nevada is a case study of the lengths Democrats will go to secure a voting edge.First Marc Elias and Perkins Coie sued the state on behalf of Democrat groups, demanding election officials break laws against ballot harvesting, ignore signature verification requirements and send ballots to inactive voters the state believes moved away. They demanded more in-person voting locations while arguing voting in person was too dangerous for the June 9 mail-in vote primary.VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: CORONAVIRUS DEEPENS DIVISIONS — EXCEPT MAYBE THIS ONE BIT OF COMMON GROUNDThe message was sent, and Democrats in Clark County got in line. A new voting plan was reached “shrouded in mystery,” according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Officials would now increase the number of in-person voting locations in the Democrat-heavy region, mail ballots to all “voters” and allow “field registrars,” commonly known as ballot harvesters, to pick them up. All at the expense of taxpayers of $323,000, and the rule of law.The result has made Clark County look more like Tammany Hall. What is unfolding should concern every American.Weeks before the election, live ballots are piling up at apartment complexes. Others are found in the trash. The Review-Journal reported one postal worker has already found thousands of ballots that are “no good,” just “sitting in crates with no additional safeguards.” Jenny Trobiani, who has worked for the U.S. Postal Service for over three decades, said the ballots were for residents who “had all moved or died.” She even received one in the mail for her deceased mother.Dozens of ballots are being found pinned to community bulletin boards. “From Friday to Monday, I could have voted 20 times,” said one resident of an apartment complex in Las Vegas. “That’s what’s so concerning about all this.”Who is to stop a Democrat “field registrar” from picking them up, signing them and dropping them off? That sounds outrageous. But it is what Democrat groups are seeking in their lawsuit.Trained poll officials would no longer be able to throw out fraudulent ballots that do not match their signature on file. Instead, the lawsuit would prohibit what it calls the “dubious art of signature matching” and circumvent Nevada’s ballot harvesting ban. Signature matching is so “dubious” it has been required for every new voter registration in Nevada and used to verify every voter who shows up at the polls for years.This is not unique to Nevada. Democrats are attacking the integrity of our elections across the country and circling the wagons.Democrats are welcoming voter fraud in Nevada. And they are not even hiding it.The Elias lawsuit is explicit. It states the statewide ban on ballot harvesting “hamstrings” the ability of Democrat groups, including the Democratic National Committee, the Nevada State Democratic Party, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Priorities USA, to “assist voters in making the transition to vote by mail.”Democrats are happy to “assist,” as long as you vote Democrat.This is not unique to Nevada. Democrats are attacking the integrity of our elections across the country and circling the wagons.From Planned Parenthood to the Center for American Progress, left-wing activist groups are pushing the same false talking points that while we flatten the curve we must upend our elections. Voting must be more “inclusive” (by adopting liberal policies).Nancy Pelosi’s $3 trillion bill would launch a federal takeover of our elections, all in line with Elias’ lawsuits in 29 states. Their mission is to nationalize ballot harvesting, gut signature verification and voter ID laws and send millions of ballots to voters who have died or moved away, before November.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThat's why the Republican National Committee and Trump campaign have launched our Protect the Vote effort, a digital platform which spotlights our efforts to protect against the Democrats' assault on our elections as they push for sweeping changes, including vote-by-mail and more ballot harvesting amid the coronavirus pandemicThe opportunity for fraud with these Democrat proposals is enormous. There are over 200,000 inactive voters in Clark County alone. Inactive voters are given the opportunity to update their registrations and can still request a ballot in the upcoming election. Individuals are only deemed inactive after the state receives evidence from the Postal Service that they have moved.“Knowingly mailing a ballot to a wrong address is bad enough,” a Review-Journal editorial recently argued. “Combining that with the elimination of signature verification is an open invitation to shenanigans and makes absolutely no sense.”CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThat’s why this week I sent a letter to Nevada Attorney General Aaron D. Ford requesting an investigation into Clark County’s backroom deal, and potential violations of state election and open meeting laws. Democrat officials in Clark County did not allow any public input before unilaterally upending its election procedures.Our elections must be free, fair and secure. They should not enable voter fraud at the taxpayers’ expense.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RONNA MCDANIEL"
"Rep. Roger Marshall, M.D.: WHO desperately needs reform – here’s how to protect global health now",OPINION,"Rep. Roger Marshall, M.D.",2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.For the last 70 years, the U.S. and countries around the world have put their trust in the World Health Organization (WHO) to alert the global community of disease outbreaks and provide technical expertise in public health. In return, the WHO has – time and again – demonstrated its systemic organizational problems and lack of accountability.The COVID-19 pandemic is just one more example of the WHO’s willingness to let politics govern over their core responsibility as a global public health watchdog.As a physician, I’m especially concerned about the WHO’s failure to properly respond to these outbreaks. Nearly 100,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, and this international health organization must be held to strict medical and information sharing standards going forward.AVELLA AND DUGAN: GEORGIA VS. CORONAVIRUS — THESE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCEDecisions by the WHO guide and impact the abilities of medical providers to provide proper guidance and care for their patients.The director-general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom, made several disastrous mistakes in mitigating and preventing the COVID-19 outbreak. On Jan. 14, the Chinese government denied human-to-human transmission of the virus was occurring, and the WHO quickly endorsed their message. It’s shocking that the WHO made no attempt to independently verify the claims of an undemocratic government widely known for its iron muzzle on the media, the “Great Firewall” of Internet controls, and an unapologetic history of concealing the truth.Then again, this easy solidarity with China is no surprise when considering Tedros was largely backed by China when seeking the WHO’s top position. More notably, his home country is one of Africa’s leading partners for China’s “Belt and Road Initiative” and China remains their largest source of foreign investment.Politics, unfortunately, had much to do with the Tedros decision to state that the Chinese response to the outbreak was “transparent” and had his full confidence. As Tedros was helping the Chinese government, hospitals across Wuhan became overwhelmed by sick patients while Chinese officials silenced the medical community with one hand, and stockpiled personal protective equipment with the other.However, thanks to unwavering international pressure, Tedros declared the outbreak a public health emergency and changed course.It is time to reevaluate the organizational structure of the WHO to ensure future responses are based on science, not propaganda.It’s doubtful the WHO would have reacted differently without Tedros catering to China. This isn’t the organization’s first failure at responding to a disease outbreak. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic sparked heavy criticism of the WHO’s poor performance and prompted many external and internal investigations calling for reform. While some reform measures have been adopted, WHO continues to lack accountability, and without it, medical expertise and public health will always come second to politics and propaganda.Independent investigations of the COVID-19 outbreak will undoubtedly be written and recommendations for reform will be outlined. Minor technical changes will be adopted and the ones threatening political favor will be ignored. In order to ensure meaningful changes are actually made, countries need to abandon the carrot and grab the stick.The U.S. is the largest volunteer contributor to the WHO, and with these persistent problems, the Trump administration rightly decided to halt funding pending an investigation into its handling of the COVID-19 outbreak.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERAs the Trump administration continues to pry open political motivations driving the WHO, over 60 countries, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, as well as the European Union, have signed a resolution backing the investigation. That resolution was recently adopted unanimously during a virtual meeting of the World Health Assembly, despite repeated complaints from China.It is time to reevaluate the organizational structure of the WHO to ensure future responses are based on science, not propaganda.Participating countries should consider establishing a small select voting body of medical experts, similar to the structure of the United Nations Security Council, with the purpose of championing cooperation in solving global health issues. This body could oversee significant policy issues like outbreaks, major capital expenditures, and assess actions taken by other countries during public health emergencies.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAccountability comes with the power to make decisions that member states are then obligated to implement. This would be supplemented with international pressure.The U.S. — the largest single provider of humanitarian assistance, the largest contributor to the WHO, and global watchdog — must lead this fight to ensure the WHO fulfills its role in global health and pandemic response.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP.

Rep. Mike Gallagher: Is Congress nonessential? It's acting that way — but here's how we can fix that,OPINION,Mike Gallagher | Fox News,2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.The coronavirus crisis has forced all Americans to ask the question: what are the essential and non-essential things in our lives?Amid this debate, as Americans struggle to survive the shutdown and as our country struggles to avoid a prolonged recession, it is odd that Congress, through its actions, would openly declare itself nonessential. Congress has, after all, not congressed in any meaningful sense for over two months.During this time the largest spending bill in American history passed without amendments or a recorded vote. Last week Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., passed a rule allowing Congress to stay out of session until mid-July and a proxy voting proposal that would undo centuries of precedent and allow the speaker to pass legislation with less than 25 out of 435 members present.AVELLA AND DUGAN: GEORGIA VS. CORONAVIRUS — THESE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCEIn other words, approximately 5 percent of the members of Congress are essential and the rest of us are nonessential.These developments should not come as a surprise. They are essentially the culmination of decades of dereliction of constitutional duty by Congress. We have gone from the Framers fearing that the legislature would necessarily predominate and suck everything into its impetuous vortex to the current situation where Congress has decided, like a character in the film ""Office Space,"" that it is not going to quit, it is just going to stop going to work.What little power remains in the increasingly powerless institution is in the hands of an increasingly small number of people at the top of the legislative hierarchy. As I wrote two years ago reflecting on my first term in Congress: “I have come to believe that the problem (with Congress) is not the people. The problem is a defective process and a power structure that, whichever party is in charge, funnels all power to leadership and stifles debate and initiative within the ranks…“Leadership determines which bills come to the floor for a vote, leadership chooses loyal committee chairs so as to ensure that bills opposed by special interests will be killed in committee, and in the event that problematic amendments do make it to the House floor, the Rules Committee — an organ of the speaker — kills them off. The legislation that does pass tends to come in last-second omnibus bills that legislators have no chance to read, let alone debate and amend.”Two years later, the problem has gotten even worse. House Democratic leadership no longer need to rely on such subtle tactics to stifle debate and force rank-and-file members to cast up or down votes on multi-trillion dollar legislative packages: they now can simply keep us outside of Washington, D.C., and call a few of us back whenever the speaker needs their votes.How do we fix Congress? A good start would be to end the vacation and reconvene in person,President Obama said last weekend, “This pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge don’t know what they’re doing. A lot of them aren’t even pretending to be in charge.” I assume he was talking about Congress under Pelosi’s leadership. If so, I have to say what I don’t often say: I agree with President Obama.I know some conservatives might be tempted to think Congress’ inability to pass laws is a net positive. Yet the opposite is true. A feckless Congress further empowers unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats in the executive branch and activist judges in the judicial branch. A weak Congress passing complex, unreadable, 1,000-page bills written by a small group of staffers empowers special interests and fortifies the status quo against meaningful reform.A functional Congress is, in other words, essential. It is essential now more than ever.At a time when we are rapidly spending trillions of dollars that we do not have to combat coronavirus, Congress has to do oversight to ensure this money is having a positive impact.As we ramp up domestic manufacturing of PPE, it will require legislation passed by Congress to strengthen our medical supply chains and thereby wean America off of our dangerous dependency on cheap Chinese goods.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERAs we confront relentless Chinese Communist Party propaganda, Congress must come together and figure out a foundation for winning this New Cold War.How do we fix Congress? A good start would be to end the vacation and reconvene in person, for at least two weeks, so that we can start to do our committee work, which cannot be done by proxy. This should in turn lead to an enduring change in the congressional schedule, where we end this foolish practice of flying in and out of town each week for meaningless votes.While we are at it, Democrats should join the newly launched China Task Force so Congress can reassert its role U.S. foreign policy and send a strong signal of support to our friends in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang suffering from coercion and oppression by the Chinese Communist Party.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt would also be a good idea to drain the pesky swamp that seems to just get swampier. Eventually this means we will need a complete overhaul and simplification of the budget committee and appropriations process. But for now, let’s start small with a simple prohibition on former members of Congress lobbying on behalf of foreign entities.As we emerge from the coronavirus crisis, Congress must reclaim its rightful constitutional authority.

Singles listing coronavirus antibody test results on dating apps,Relationships,"Hannah Frishberg, _Suzy Weiss | New York Post",2020-05-22,"They’re single and have the paperwork to mingle.Singles across the country are boasting about their coronavirus antibody test results when they’re out on the prowl.

"Baby pygmy hippo born at San Diego Zoo, conquers the internet with cuteness",Mammals,Mindy Weisberger - Senior Writer | LiveScience,2020-05-22,"The San Diego Zoo recently announced its newest (and arguably cutest) arrival: a newborn male pygmy hippo, born on April 9 to its 4-year-old pygmy hippo mama Mabel.Within hours of birth, the very tubby youngster was standing up and following its mother around, toddling after her in the hippos' indoor habitat, zoo representatives said in a statement.The baby, which has not yet been named, weighed 12.4 lbs. (5.6 kilograms) at birth and now weighs about 25 lbs. (11 kg). This is the first successful pygmy hippo birth at the zoo in more than three decades, offering hope for the future of this endangered species, according to the statement.Related: Photos: World's cutest baby wild animalsIn the maternity ""ward"" of the hippo habitat, the calf now has access to a pool, after first testing the waters in a shallow tub. Over the last few weeks, the baby demonstrated that it was able to close its nostrils and hold its breath underwater.As their name implies, pygmy hippos (Choeropsis liberiensis) are significantly smaller than river hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius), according to the San Diego Zoo. Adult pygmy hippos weigh about 350 to 600 lbs. (160 to 270 kg), while river hippos can weigh up to 10 times more. The heads of pygmy hippos are also blunter and rounder than those of their bigger hippo cousins, and pygmy hippos' eyes are located on the sides of their heads rather than at the top.Pygmy hippos often look shiny and slick even when they aren't in the water, thanks to a pinkish fluid called ""blood sweat"" that oozes from their skin. This liquid acts like a moisturizing sunscreen; it keeps their skin from drying and cracking in the heat and protects the hippos from sunburn, according to the zoo.Fewer than 2,500 pygmy hippos remain in their native habitats in West Africa, where they live in forest rivers in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire.Mabel and her calf will remain separated from the calf's father, a 13-year-old named Elgon, as pygmy hippos do not typically live together as families, zoo representatives said. In about a month, the baby and his mother will emerge from their seclusion in the indoor enclosure and will begin taking turns with Elgon to spend time in the main hippo habitat.Originally published on Live Science."
Lori Loughlin’s career and image could be ‘tainted’ after guilty plea in college admissions scandal: expert,Exclusive,Julius Young,2020-05-22,"Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, have agreed to plead guilty in the college admissions scandal case that loomed over them for more than a year.Although the date of their expected guilty plea has not yet been determined, the Massachusetts District Attorney’s Office announced on Thursday that Loughlin will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, while Giannulli will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and to honest services wire and mail fraud.If the judge accepts the terms of their plea agreement, both will do time in prison. Loughlin would serve two months and pay a $150,000 fine along with two years of supervised release and 100 hours of community service. Giannulli, meanwhile, would serve five months in prison, pay a $250,000 fine with two years of supervised release and 250 hours of community service.LORI LOUGHLIN MUST PREPARE FOR ‘TRIAL OF HER LIFE’ AFTER JUDGE REFUSES TO DISMISS CHARGES, LEGAL EXPERT SAYSNow, with the big hurdle seemingly behind the “Full House” alum, many questions remain as to whether Loughlin will be able to bounce back and salvage her career in show business and if the public will be able to see past her transgressions moving forward.“Hollywood tends to be pretty forgiving if it's a nonviolent crime and also it depends on the times we're living in. We're in a time where there's a lot of cheating and a lot of corruption and things going on that are very telling about people,” KerrPR President Cherie Kerr, who is not involved in the case, told Fox News on Thursday soon after the plea agreements were announced.LORI LOUGHLIN'S 'FULL HOUSE' CO-STAR DAVE COULIER SAYS HE 'WILL BE THERE FOR HER FOREVER' AMID SCANDAL DRAMAThe personal and corporate crisis manager continued: “For instance, the fact that [Lori] lied about both daughters' athletic ability – that's a real problem. That's worse than her just sending somebody some money as an influence and to get [her daughters] in and then say, 'Oh well, I didn't really know what I was doing and this guy [William 'Rick' Singer] put himself out to be someone who was just a coordinator to get my kids in school. So when you start lying as she did about her daughters and their background – and they found out they weren't rowers – that's the problem because that's really deceitful.”Kerr believes that Loughlin “should have walked off the field long ago” as her former co-defendant in the elaborate admissions scheme, actress Felicity Huffman, elected to do early on in the case before prosecutors put the squeeze on the remaining parents. Huffman served 11 of the 14 days handed to her and began completing her court-mandated community service back in November 2019.“She didn't fight it and get off and even if she had, there was a lot of damage done,” Kerr said. “It's generally not just one thing, but I think her career and her image is tainted from here on out because of what happened. If she's not well thought of as a mother, to a lot of people in the public that will be a big black mark against her.”Kerr said Loughlin should get ahead of the matter in the media, if permitted by the terms of her plea agreement, and should explain her reasoning behind making the large payments and staging the photos of her daughters -- Olivia Jade Giannulli and Isabella Giannulli -- for their admittance into the University of Southern California.LORI LOUGHLIN ‘OUTRAGED,’ DAUGHTER OLIVIA JADE ‘EMBARRASSED’ BY PROSECUTORS RELEASING ROWING PICS, REPORTS SAY“What happens with the press is that whoever has the most ink or airtime is the one where the public's sway is moved toward that side, but if she's not going to say anything and she's not going to do anything, I think she's going to have a problem,” said Kerr.“So if she has any kind of defense – if she wants to do a mea culpa or she wants to say this is really what went down and how it went down – we were desperate or whatever – she should be out there talking,” Kerr maintained. “Some people just decide to go away and leave it alone for a while. But I always say, if the story's out there and you made a deal and that's what you did and you have a way to explain that away – then do it.”“People used to go on with Barbara Walters for a whole hour and explain why they did what they did,” Kerr added.Prominent San Diego criminal defense attorney David Shapiro, also not attached to the matter, echoed the sentiment of Kerr that Loughlin’s chances of coming away victorious were slim and believes that a portion of the general public will scoff at the two months in federal prison Loughlin may have to serve behind bars if the judge accepts the terms of the plea agreement.LORI LOUGHLIN'S PLEA AGREEMENT: WHAT THE TERMS MEAN“Lori Loughlin’s fate was likely sealed, one way or the other, well before this guilty plea,” said Shapiro. “Some in the general public may not be happy with anything short of a lengthy prison commitment. She absolutely appears to have cheated the system, but got caught and now is labeled a felon.”“Only time shall tell what Loughlin’s legacy will be,” he added. “Many will remember her as ‘Aunt Becky’ from ‘Full House,’ and nothing more. Others will view this [pending] conviction as a black eye she can never recover from. Others will look back and see a mother who was willing to risk it all for the good of her children, albeit via illegal means.”However, current white-collar criminal defense attorney Michael Zweiback – who is a former Assistant U.S. Attorney and prosecutor in the Central District of California and is also not involved in the legal proceedings – takes the opposite view of Kerr, and while he’s sure that ""the stain will require a significant amount of time” for the matter to cycle out of the news, Loughlin “will have an opportunity to resume her career at some point.”“A lot depends upon how she acts from this point forward. Is she showing remorse? Does the narrative change from her being a victim of an overzealous government prosecution to ‘I am sorry for my actions?’"" Zweiback explained to Fox News on Thursday. “The judge will look to that when determining whether to accept this agreement and sentence her accordingly. [And] the public will also be watching for this.”OLIVIA JADE: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT LORI LOUGHLIN’S DAUGHTER AT THE CENTER OF THE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDALMeanwhile, considering the current happenings in the world and whether the ongoing coronavirus pandemic will hurt or help Loughlin’s ability to gain favor with the public, Kerr said there's a slippery slope to navigate in the fact that people may be so involved in their own life dealings that the outcome of the scandal could be eclipsed.“Well, that can play out on both sides. They can say, 'Yeah, who cares? We're in a much more serious situation and all she did was send some money and photos and got her kids in the school she wanted them to go to. That pales in comparison to what's happening otherwise,'"" Kerr explained. “But then they can also have a lot more time to sit and watch television and look at the news coverage because they're not working. So it can work both ways.”Kerr also anticipates that there will be a number of factors that will come into play on whether the scandal will define Loughlin and if Hollywood decides they’re willing to take a gamble on the fallen star.“That's really hard to say because it depends on what happens over the next few years,” said Kerr, who is often called upon by high-power attorneys to assist in image-strategizing for their clients. “And don't forget – and I think this is unfortunate the way it is – but she's an aging actress and her heyday was when she was quite a bit younger. So that's a factor that would have to be considered.”LORI LOUGHLIN 'NERVOUS' AFTER JUDGE REFUSES TO DISMISS CHARGES IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS CASE: REPORTAsked if Loughlin’s YouTube star daughter Olivia will be able to land on her feet in the eyes of the public following the scandal? Kerr believes so though the task will take some massaging.“The public will be swayed by whoever gets the most press and the most positive press or the most credibility,” she explained. “So if she got a bad shake because it was really her mother who persuaded her to do this, people will probably forgive her, but it's going to take some rehabilitation [and] that's going to be doing some acts of charity and stepping up, admitting it and then walking away from it and trying to build something bigger and better.”CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP“It usually is a matter of time and it can be months or a couple of years or what have you before somebody starts to emerge more prominently and comes back,” added Kerr. “It depends on who they are and what they've done.”"

I had a good showing, put on a little bit of an exciting show there at the end,"" he said.Busch said wife Samantha reached out to Marissa to offer solace. The Busch family had similar heartache in the past.Briscoe appreciated the words of consolation from the Busches and all the friends in NASCAR he's heard from the past two days.Busch and Timmy Hill were in all three Darlington races.

Sign up here.As film and television productions prepare to resume after halting during the coronavirus outbreak, studios are turning to a new strategy to keep sets safe.Hollywood execs have reportedly taken notice of a ""germ-zapping robot,"" a device that uses ultraviolet light to kill the virus.Testing at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute indicated that the robot is 99.9 percent effective at killing the virus and can clean a surface in two minutes. The machine, manufactured by Xenex Disinfection Services, can clean an N95 mask in five minutes.SONY PICTURES WORKING ON FEMALE-CENTRIC SUPERHERO MOVIE BASED ON MARVEL CHARACTERS: REPORTOfficially trademarked as the ""Xenex Germ-Zapping Robot,"" the tech is part of Xenex co-founder and CSO Dr. Mark Stibich's Production Safe Zone venture, formed with former filmmaker Justin Golding, according to The Hollywood Reporter.The program is aimed at helping films and television shows resume productions safely by killing particles of the novel virus that can live on some surfaces for days.The outlet reports that Stibich and Golding have approached Tinseltown titans such as Netflix, Sony and Amazon to discuss the bots.""The way we like to think of it is that our pathogens, like coronavirus, have evolved — but our tools that clean the environment haven't,"" Stibich told THR.

'Tiger King': A look at all follow-up adaptation projects,TV,Nate Day,2020-05-22,"When Netflix first debuted ""Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness"" back in March, the docuseries captured 34 million US viewers in the first 10 days of its release.With many people stuck at home due to the coronavirus quarantine, they turned to their TVs and tuned into the story of Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin, two large cat enthusiasts with an intense rivalry.From the oddball music videos to the mistreatment of animals and, of course, an arrest made in a murder-for-hire case, viewers were so gripped by the story that several follow-up projects have cropped up to tell the story of ""Tiger King.""'GOT' STAR CARICE VAN HOUTEN SAYS 'IT FEELS A BIT UNGRATEFUL' AFTER FANS' NEGATIVE RESPONSE TO FINAL SEASONHere's a look at the upcoming adaptations of the must-see-it-to-believe-it story:A Kate McKinnon TV seriesBefore the Netflix docuseries debuted, the story of Joe Exotic -- real name Joseph Maldonado-Passage -- was publicly shared in a Wondery podcast called ""Joe Exotic: Tiger King.""Like the Netflix show, the podcast explored Maldonado-Passage's relationship with Baskin and discussed the accusations of her involvement with her previous husband's disappearance.In November, it was announced that ""Saturday Night Live"" star Kate McKinnon would play Baskin in an upcoming television series, though a date of release or network has yet to be announced.KRISTIN CAVALLARI ENDING REALITY TELEVISION SHOW 'VERY CAVALLARI' AMID JAY CUTLER DIVORCEIt is unclear whether the project is a miniseries or a full-length television show.Podcast host Robert Moor has said that he's ""involved"" with the series, and told Andy Cohen that among the names being discussed to join the series are Sam Rockwell, John C.

"Massive, rotating disk galaxy from the early universe discovered",Astronomy,James Rogers,2020-05-21,"A massive, rotating disk galaxy from the early universe has been discovered by an international team of astronomers.Galaxy DLA0817g, dubbed the ""Wolfe Disk"" after the late astronomer Arthur M. Wolfe, was discovered using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile. The Wolfe Disk is the most distant rotating disk galaxy ever observed, according to UC Santa Cruz, which participated in the research.The research has been published in the journal Nature.BRIGHTEST EVER SUPERNOVA DISCOVERED, STUNNING SCIENTISTSSimilar to our Milky Way, the galaxy spins at 170 miles per second, the researchers explained in a statement.“Its properties are astonishingly similar to our own galaxy, despite being only 1.5 billion years old,” said the paper’s co-author J. Xavier Prochaska, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, in the statement.The researchers note that most huge disk galaxies, like our own Milky Way, reach their large mass relatively late in the 13.8-billion-year history of the universe.BLACK HOLE, 1,000 LIGHT-YEARS FROM EARTH, DISCOVERED“While previous studies hinted at the existence of these early rotating gas-rich disk galaxies, thanks to ALMA we now have unambiguous evidence that they occur as early as 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang,” said lead author Marcel Neeleman of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany.NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and the National Science Foundation’s Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) were also used to study the Wolfe Disk.The galaxy was first discovered in 2017 by ALMA when it examined the light from a more distant quasar, or highly active supermassive black hole. ""The light from the quasar was absorbed as it passed through a massive reservoir of hydrogen gas surrounding the galaxy, which is how it revealed itself,"" the researchers explained, in the statement.

"Lori Loughlin, Mossimo Giannulli to plead guilty in college admissions scandal",College Admissions Scandal,Tyler McCarthy,2020-05-21,"Lori Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli have agreed to plead guilty in the college admissions scandal case and to each serve time behind bars after more than a year of maintaining their innocence.The Massachusetts District Attorney’s Office announced Thursday that the couple will plead guilty at a yet-to-be-determined court date. Loughlin will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, while Giannulli will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and to honest services wire and mail fraud.If the judge accepts the terms of their plea agreement, both will do time in prison. Loughlin would serve two months and pay a $150,000 fine along with two years of supervised release and 100 hours of community service. Giannulli, meanwhile, would serve five months in prison, pay a $250,000 fine with two years of supervised release and 250 hours of community service.WHAT COUNTRIES HAVE NOT DECLARED ANY KNOWN CASES OF CORONAVIRUS?They will become the 23rd and 24th parents to plead guilty in the college admissions scandal, which came to light last year and saw parents pay large sums to scam mastermind William “Rick” Singer to get their kids admitted to the school of their choice through various allegedly fraudulent means.“Under the plea agreements filed today, these defendants will serve prison terms reflecting their respective roles in a conspiracy to corrupt the college admissions process and which are consistent with prior sentences in this case. We will continue to pursue accountability for undermining the integrity of college admissions,” United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling said in a statement.CORONAVIRUS VACCINE DEVELOPMENT: WHERE DOES IT STAND?Loughlin and Giannulli previously pleaded not guilty to expanded charges of bribery brought against them in October along with 11 other parents swept up in the scandal. The duo has been accused of arranging a total collective payment of $500,000 to Singer to get their daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella, recruited to USC as athletes on the crew team, despite never having participated in the sport.CORONAVIRUS: 5 UNUSUAL WAYS PEOPLE REACTEDThe charge of conspiracy to commit federal program bribery carries a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. The couple was previously hit with charges of money laundering and conspiracy that carried a potential sentence of 40 years if convicted on all of them.Nearly two dozen parents have already pleaded guilty in the case, including former “Desperate Housewives” star Felicity Huffman. She served almost two weeks in prison after she admitted to paying $15,000 to have someone correct her daughter’s entrance exam answers.The decision for the famous couple to plead guilty is in stark contrast to their legal defense from mere weeks ago. They previously asked U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton to dismiss charges against them after they believed they’d found potentially exonerating evidence.In court documents previously obtained by Fox News, attorneys for the famous couple argued that the entire case should be thrown out after notes from Singer seemingly showed that agents had urged him to lie in order to implicate parents like Loughlin and Giannulli in committing a criminal act.The couple’s defense also alleged that the prosecution was withholding this evidence for fear it was exonerating to their clients. However, Variety reported at the time that in a new April 8 court filing, the prosecution denied both that it acted in bad faith and that the evidence is at all exonerating.TOP CORONAVIRUS SCAMS TO BE AWARE OF“In a sprawling, fast-moving prosecution, the failure to produce the notes earlier was simply a mistake,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven E. Frank wrote at the time. “The defendants have suffered no prejudice, and their suggestion that the notes somehow ‘exonerate’ them, or reveal that the evidence against them was fabricated, is demonstrably false.”In his notes, Singer wrote that investigators told him to lie to get parents to make incriminating statements over recorded phone calls. The agents instructed him to say he told the parents the payments were bribes, instead of donations, according to the notes made public in legal filings.“They continue to ask me to tell a fib and not restate what I told my clients as to where there money was going — to the program not the coach and that it was a donation and they want it to be a payment,” Singer wrote, according to court documents.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPGorton had called Singer’s claims in his notes “serious and disturbing.” However, he ultimately agreed with the prosecution’s assertion that it did not present ample grounds to dismiss the case. Therefore, he rejected the defense’s bid to toss the indictment earlier this month.The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Denny Hamlin wins rain-shortened Toyota 500 at Darlington Raceway,Nascar,,2020-05-21,"Denny Hamlin won NASCAR's first Wednesday race since 1984 when rain stopped the event with 20 laps remaining at Darlington Raceway.The Daytona 500 winner was out front but out of fresh tires and trying to hang on when he got unintended help from Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Kyle Busch. The reigning Cup champion caused Chase Elliott to crash eight laps earlier to bring out the caution.A furious Elliott waited for Busch on the apron of the track and flipped Busch the middle finger as he passed. As NASCAR cleaned the track, it started to rain and the cars were called to pit road under red-flag.It was an already active evening at “The Track Too Tough To Tame” as drivers were racing against the field and the weather. As the drivers sat in their cars waiting for NASCAR to pull the plug, a handful of Elliott's crew members sat on the pit wall staring down Busch.One of Busch's crew members sat between them on the wall and NASCAR eventually ordered everyone back over the wall. Eight minutes later, the race was called and Busch was greeted by Alan Gustafson, Elliott's crew chief and Busch's former crew chief when he drove for Hendrick Motorsports, for a conversation between two masked competitors.Busch immediately copped to the error.“There's no question I made a mistake and just misjudged the gap,” Busch said. “They’re upset, they’re mad. I’m not just going to fix and we’re going to go have ice cream tomorrow. They’re going to dwell on it and I’m sure there are repercussions of it I’m going to have down the road.”Meanwhile, a fox was scampering across the deserted track and Hamlin, wearing a mask that depicted his actual smile, was having a muted celebration in the rain.He walked to victory lane under a large black umbrella. It was a 1-2 finish for Joe Gibbs Racing and Toyota. Hamlin has won three times at Darlington and has two wins this season.“I got my happy face on. Made sure I brought it with me,"" Hamlin said of his mask. He said he also had masks made with a “sad face” but only brought the smiling masks to a track he counts among his favorite.Hamlin thought he was in good shape when he made his last pit stop but a caution by Clint Bowyer, who won the first two stages of the race, jumbled the strategy with 34 laps remaining.Hamlin had no choice but to stay out on the track, and his crew chief Chris Gabehart told him over the radio, “you ain't going to like it, but we're going to have to eat our vegetables here.”Hamlin, the leader because he didn't pit on the restart with 29 to go, only had to hold off traffic for one lap before the Busch and Elliott collision. The rain then came and Hamlin earned the trophy.“It’s a driver’s race track,” he said. “You can do different things to make (the car) handle. We got it right.”The race marked the first time in NASCAR history that the Cup Series had two points-paying races at the same track in one week.The start of NASCAR's second race back during the coronavirus pandemic was moved up an hour because of poor weather, but that was then delayed nearly 90 minutes because it rained most of the day.When the action finally began, the 310-mile affair was spirited from start to finish because drivers were unsure if they were racing to the halfway point — the mark a race becomes official — or the distance.NASCAR returned to action Sunday at Darlington after a 10 weeks off by using a a strict health protocol and limiting those in attendance to only the most essential for conducting a race.Health screenings were required to enter the track and each of the 40 cars were allowed just 16 team members.Fox Sports again broadcast the race primarily from a studio in Charlotte, North Carolina, with just one pit reporter at Darlington. For its prerace show, drivers used varying technology to make brief appearances while sitting alone in their motorhomes.Drivers had to travel to the track alone, pass through a health screening and then isolate before the race. They are required to wear face masks.NASCAR has an ambitious return plan of 20 races spanning its three national series between Sunday's return and June 21. Spectators are not expected to be permitted to any of the events in this span.Rain disrupted the schedule Tuesday night when the Xfinity Series was washed out. That race is now scheduled to be held Thursday afternoon.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"

"Titanic salvage firm gets approval for controversial plan to cut into wreck, retrieve telegraph machine",Digging History,James Rogers,2020-05-21,"A salvage firm has received approval from a judge in Virginia to remove the telegraph machine from the famous Titanic wreck that was used to send distress signals when the liner sank more than 100 years ago.Salvage company RMS Titanic Inc.’s plan to retrieve the Marconi wireless telegraph has sparked controversy, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration among those who have fiercely opposed the mission. NOAA argued in court documents that the telegraph is likely surrounded “by the mortal remains of more than 1,500 people,” and should be left alone.RMS Titanic Inc. submitted a 60-page plan to retrieve the telegraph, which is believed to still sit in a deckhouse near the doomed ocean liner’s grand staircase. The company said an unmanned submersible would slip through a skylight or cut the heavily corroded roof to retrieve the radio. A “suction dredge” would remove loose silt, while manipulator arms could cut electrical cords.DID THIS ICEBERG SINK THE TITANIC?Titanic hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship's time on April 14, 1912, and sank just over two hours later with the loss of more than 1,500 lives. The wreck, which is lying on seabed at a depth of 12,467 feet, is approximately 350 miles south of Newfoundland.EYOS Expeditions, which led an expedition to the wreck site last year, also voiced its concerns about RMS Titanic’s plans earlier this year.A spokesman for NOAA told Fox News that the agency is reviewing the court's decision and has no comment at this time. EYOS Expeditions also declined to comment on the court order when contacted by Fox News. ""We have no comment as this does not involve us or our expeditions in any way,"" a spokesman said.In a statement emailed to Fox News, RMS Titanic Inc. described the telegraph device as a tangible link to Titanic's past. “We remain dedicated to sharing the legacy of the Ship and her passengers with the public,"" said Bretton Hunchak, President of RMS Titanic, Inc., in the statement. ""Without the recovery, conservation and display of these artifacts, the ability to experience first-hand additional significant historic artifacts would be limited to only an exclusive group, those who have the privilege and economic means to travel to the wreck site.""The company also says that it is working to bring the history of Titanic and its artifacts to schools around the world. “It is important to RMS Titanic, Inc. that the recovery of the Marconi is part of educational outreach programs in schools,"" said Hunchak. ""We are diligently working with multiple school districts to bring both our data and expertise to students so they can be a part of history and follow along as we endeavor to make this complex recovery.""NEW TITANIC IMAGES SHOW THE WRECK’S 'SHOCKING' DETERIORATIONIn an order released Monday, U.S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith agreed that the telegraph is historically and culturally important and could soon be lost within the rapidly decaying wreck site.Smith wrote that recovering the telegraph “will contribute to the legacy left by the indelible loss of the Titanic, those who survived, and those who gave their lives in the sinking.""Smith is the maritime jurist who presides over Titanic salvage matters from a federal court in Norfolk. Her ruling modifies a previous judge’s order from the year 2000 that forbids cutting into the shipwreck or detaching any part of it.INCREDIBLE TITANIC TALE: SILVER FLASK WAS DAMAGED IN THE SHIP’S DEATH THROES, REUNITED WITH ITS OWNERThe order has been described as a big win for RMS Titanic Inc., the court-recognized salvor, or steward, of the Titanic’s artifacts. The firm recently emerged from bankruptcy and is under new ownership.Last year, an expedition to the Titanic led by EYOS Expeditions revealed the ill-fated liner’s deterioration on the North Atlantic seabed.Eerie footage of the dive obtained by the BBC showed the Titanic’s rusting bow and parts of the ship’s wrecked hull. Despite the wreck’s rapidly deteriorating state, glass can still be seen in some of the Titanic’s portholes.TITANIC CONTROVERSY: SUB USED IN UNDERWATER EXPEDITION HIT FAMOUS WRECK, SAY COURT DOCUMENTSMore than 100 years after the Titanic’s sinking, the disaster continues to be a source of fascination.

The restoration work is in preparation for a new Austrian exhibition.“A chimney flue was uncovered on the ground floor while measures were being undertaken to preserve original masonry,” the National Fund explained in a statement. “Hidden objects came to light beneath it, including knives, forks, hooks, scissors, pieces of leather, cobbler's tools and parts of shoes.”It is not yet clear why the items were hidden. “In the absence of an in-depth analysis by historians and conservators, it is still too early to discuss how they were used and the possible intentions of the prisoners – conceivable examples include making and repairing clothes, locksmithing or to prepare for an escape,” explained the National Fund. “It is also possible that the scissors and cutlery were used to barter with other prisoners.”HUNDREDS OF CHILLING ITEMS DISCOVERED AT NAZI MASSACRE SITESPrisoners with special manual skills were housed in the building where the items were found, according to the National Fund. “Survivor testimonies indicate that there were a number of workshops in the cellar where, for example, baskets were woven,” it said.The largest of the Nazi concentration camps and extermination centers used in the Holocaust, over 1.1. million men, women and children were killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau.Austria’s National Fund for the victims of Nazism was set up in 1995. The fund “renders payments to victims of National Socialism, in particular to those who had previously received little or no compensation; to those in need of special assistance or those whose personal circumstances warrant relief,” it explains, on its website.HOLOCAUST DISCOVERY: RITUAL BATHS UNCOVERED IN SYNAGOGUE COMPLEX DESTROYED BY NAZISDiscoveries such as the Auschwitz items offer a glimpse into the horrific events of World War II. Last year hundreds of chilling items were discovered at Nazi massacre sites in northwestern Germany. The finds were uncovered at three sites in the Arnsberg forest, where members of the Waffen-SS and German army massacred 208 Polish and Russian forced laborers in March 1945, just before the end of World War II.In 2017, experts uncovered two ritual baths in the remains of the Great Synagogue of Vilnius, in Lithuania, more than 70 years after its destruction during the Holocaust.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn a separate project in Lithuania, a tunnel used by Jewish prisoners to escape the Nazis was discovered.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers"

Sign up here.Fans of Netflix's ""Selling Sunset"" know Christine Quinn takes her business of selling some of the most sought-after real estate in Hollywood very seriously. But in an exclusive interview with Fox News, the blonde bombshell says fans will see a ""different side"" of her in the show's upcoming second season.The 31-year-old real estate broker was dubbed the ""villain"" by viewers of Season 1, likely due to her no-nonsense attitude in her high-pressure job at The Oppenheim Group. The Netflix series follows Quinn and her glamorous female co-workers as they attempt to sell some of the most elite mansions Los Angeles, Calif. has to offer, which of course comes with some competition and drama along the way.Quinn tells Fox News she was unbothered by the label of villain but admitted the producers ""can Frankenstein the s--t out of you."" That's why she headed into filming a bit differently this time around.THE BEST FAMILY-FRIENDLY ANIMATED SERIES ON NETFLIX""I'm a businesswoman all the way. I wanted to make sure in Season 1 that I was viewed seriously. But in Season 2 I approached it a little differently because I wanted people to see a different side of me, the softer side of me outside of the office,"" the successful real estate broker explained.Quinn secretly tied the knot with businessman Christian Richard last December and she said fans will enjoy a peek into that aspect of her personal life -- something that she says was missing from the first season.""This season is really, really different because we get really deep in season two. All of our drama in the office and outside of the office and I think you're going to see much more relationships blossom and also some that get destroyed,"" Quinn says with a chuckle.Also starring in the unscripted Netflix series is Chrishell Stause, Mary Fitzgerald, Heather Rae Young, Maya Vander and Davina Portratz. A new season means more drama and Quinn told us that this upcoming season, which airs Friday, will not disappoint.""You're going to see new friendships formed for sure and old friendships, bon voyage!"" Quinn hinted, noting that a long-lasting bond between two stars in the first season will be no more.Quinn also discussed how her job at The Oppenheim Group has currently been placed on pause due to the coronavirus pandemic. Right now, she says, the team is enjoying a bit of a break before it's back to hitting the pavement and finding clients their dream homes.""I've been taking up cooking and just doing things that I never really would have had the time to do so it's actually the perfect storm right now. I'm enjoying the calm but I hate my freedom being taken away -- that's the one thing that's been difficult to deal with,"" Quinn explained.On camera, Quinn and her fashionable co-stars often flock to mega-mansions in the middle of home renovations rocking designer heels. But in quarantine, Quinn admits she's much more low-key.""When I'm not working I am so casual!"" she laughs. ""I'm always in sweatpants and always in pajamas. I never put makeup on. It's nice to have a break from the makeup and hair and the outfits. I'm really enjoying that right now.""Still, Quinn knows now is a crucial time for clients to be zoning in on real estate. She says that she's been able to share some tips of the trade with clients, even from home.""It's smart for someone with a stable income to refinance. These are some of the smallest numbers we've seen in history,"" Quinn explained of the real estate market at the moment. ""It's a great time to even pick up a second home or invest in a property so there's things I'm trying to do to get people aware of how to take advantage. But it's still hard. People are still having a difficult time spending money right now.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAnd while quarantine is the perfect time to catch up on shows and binge-watch new ones, Season 2 of ""Selling Sunset"" premieres on Netflix on Friday.""The stakes are higher, the houses are sexier, the drama is more and the fashions are just amazing,"" Quinn promises fans.

"Bulls championships with Doug Collins as head coach weren’t going to happen, former players say",NBA,Ryan Gaydos,2020-05-21,"Doug Collins failed to get an opportunity to lead Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls to an NBA championship and some former players believe it may have been a blessing in disguise for the former NBA superstar.Collins was out as head coach after losing in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1989. He was replaced with Phil Jackson, who would eventually help the Bulls win six championships.DENNIS RODMAN CALLS OUT FORMER BULLS TEAMMATES' COMPLAINTS ON PORTRAYAL IN 'THE LAST DANCE'Bill Cartwright and Ron Harper, two former Bulls players, believe that, while Collins was a great coach, he couldn’t have done the job Jackson did to take the Bulls to an NBA Finals victory. The two discussed Collins in a BetOnline video on Wednesday.“Probably not,” Cartwright said when asked whether the Bulls win a title with Collins. “One of the reasons why Doug was let go was because he was unable to incorporate Tex Winter, who was Jerry Krause’s first hire. Couple of interesting things happened. Once Phil was hired we incorporated Tex and the triangle. The other thing is we incorporated Al Vermiel, who was Jerry Krause’s second hire. I just think those two things are really integral and took us all the way with our game plan.”Harper agreed and added that Collins wanted Jordan to lead the league in scoring instead of building an offense in which everybody got involved.SPURS WOULD HAVE BEATEN MICHAEL JORDAN-LED BULLS IN HYPOTHETICAL 1999 NBA FINALS, EX-PLAYER SAYS“Jerry Krause made the move to hire Phil and Phil knew the only way they could win as a basketball team was to incorporate everybody,” Harper said. “The triangle offense allowed everybody to touch the basketball and play with the basketball.""“If you have one guy out there dominating the basketball and scoring the basketball, you ain’t going to win a lot of basketball games. You’re going to win a lot of games, but you ain’t going to be a championship team. Phil, the coaching staff, they allowed Phil to have more of a plan with MJ and say, ‘You’re going to score but we need the other guys to help the team. You’re going to score your points but we need you to get these guys to become better players in the roles they had.’ So without Phil and the coaching staff I don’t think they would have won a championship.”CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COMThe Jackson-coached Bulls won their first NBA title in 1991 as part of their first three-peat. He coached the Bulls until 1998 when the team disbanded. He would later coach the Los Angeles Lakers and win five more championships as their head coach."
Scottie Pippen's portrayal in 'The Last Dance' an issue with former Bulls players,NBA,Ryan Gaydos,2020-05-21,"Several former Chicago Bulls players believe Scottie Pippen got the short end of the straw during “The Last Dance” documentary and feel he should have been portrayed better.Craig Hodges, Bill Cartwright and Horace Grant discussed Pippen’s portrayal in discussion with BetOnline on Wednesday. All three former players felt Pippen should have been treated more fairly and that Chicago may not have had some of its great success without Pippen.SCOTTIE PIPPEN IS 'BEYOND LIVID' ABOUT HOW MICHAEL JORDAN PORTRAYED HIM IN 'THE LAST DANCE'The players mentioned Pippen electing not to rehab an injury until the start of the 1997-98 season and how Pippen sat for the final seconds of a 1994 playoff game against the New York, which the documentary revealed was addressed in the locker room after the game.“It was straight-up bulls—t. It was straight-up bulls—t how they portrayed Scottie,” Grant said. “First off, being the No. 2 on that team and how he came out in terms of against Utah could barely walk, setting screens, getting knocked on the floor, the whole nine yards, and for them, that documentary, to call him…well, MJ called him selfish, that’s some BS. That’s straight-up BS.“If it wasn’t for Scottie Pippen there would be no six championships. I’m telling you right now guys. The first championship I think MJ got in foul trouble against the Lakers and who came to the rescue? No. 33. Scottie Pippen. Scottie Pippen. Yes, he made a mistake. We addressed that after the game. And then it was over with and we took the Knicks to seven games. My question is: How in the hell did that get on this documentary when MJ’s a-s wasn’t even on the team.”DENNIS RODMAN CALLS OUT FORMER BULLS TEAMMATES' COMPLAINTS ON PORTRAYAL IN 'THE LAST DANCE'Cartwright said that the 1993-94 season was when Pippen evolved as a player because he didn’t have Jordan and made a mistake in the infamous Knicks game.“It’s interesting that when the play when Pip did not come back in the game, that was Pip’s best year. He had evolved into a leadership role, played great,” Cartwright said. “To me, people make mistakes and then you move on from them. I think Scottie has a big heart. And when I first got to the Bulls he wasn’t a great shooter, skinny, extraordinarily talented, so everything he had he worked for. For me Pip was a great teammate and like I said it was one man’s show and that’s what they saw. But that’s not really reality.”Hodges was Pippen’s teammate for the final four years of his career, from 1989 to 1992. He said he feels like Michael Jordan would not have won anything without Pippen.“I’m still kind of upset about it because I know the type of brother that Scottie is. Scottie is the type of brother, I wasn’t part of the team when he didn’t stand up and come back out and play during that play, but I know that Scottie is the type of cat that will give his shirt for you, go on the ground for you and kick out the shot for you. I didn’t like how he was portrayed and I don’t understand the reasoning behind it and I’m still trying to figure that out,” Hodges said.PICTURE OF MICHAEL JORDAN'S ICONIC SHOT REVEALS LOTS OF HIDDEN GEMS, PHOTOGRAPHER SAYS“Without Scottie, MJ would not have won. It’s like all the brothers sitting here. It’s almost like MJ won in a vacuum and it wasn’t anything like that. To throw your brother, especially no. 33, under the bus, that wasn’t cool.”WARNING - GRAPHIC LANGUAGEAccording to David Kaplan of ESPN 1000 in Chicago, Pippen, who won six NBA championships with Jordan and the Chicago Bulls during the ‘90s, is “so angry” and “beyond livid” at his teammate for how he came across in the documentary.Pippen’s unhappiness derives from Jordan calling him ""selfish"" and that he ""didn't realize what he was getting himself into"" with the 10-part series that spanned five weeks.CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM""[Pippen] felt like up until the last few minutes of Game 6 against the Jazz [in the 1998 NBA Finals], it was just 'bash Scottie, bash Scottie, bash Scottie,'"" Kaplan said Wednesday.Fox News’ Dan Canova contributed to this report."

"Coronavirus may expand remote work across many industries, analysts say",Coronavirus,Frank Miles,2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.Tech giants were the first to send their employees home as the coronavirus pandemic spread to the U.S. Now they’re among the last to bring them back to the office. Some of their employees might never go back.Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Twitter are studying what their highly paid, highly valued employees want, using their own technology to make remote work easier and looking to hire new workers outside of big city hubs. It’s a potentially huge turnaround after years in which companies like Amazon and Google chased scarce tech talent by opening or expanding offices in hip urban locations such as San Francisco and New York.Such a shift might also amount to a repudiation of the notion that creative work demands corporate campuses reminiscent of college, with free food, ping pong tables and open office plans designed to encourage unplanned interactions.CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOWThe result could re-imagine not just Silicon Valley but other cities as the companies expand hiring in places like Atlanta, Dallas and Denver, where Facebook plans to open new “hubs” for its new, mostly remote hires.It’s too early to know whether remote work options will mean an exodus of highly-paid tech workers from San Francisco and Silicon Valley, where they’ve contributed to skyrocketing rents and housing prices. But Facebook’s employee survey suggests that at least some of its employees would leave the San Francisco Bay Area if given the option.For companies that have built their empires on letting people communicate with far-flung friends and colleagues, moving toward remote work is not too hard of a sell. But there are many challenges. Collaboration, spontaneity, face-to-face interactions that aren’t on a scheduled call — all look different when people are working alone from their homes.There are also some jobs — in Facebook’s case, the toughest content reviewing that deals with suicides, child abuse and other traumatizing material; sales; building, upgrading and maintaining data centers; lawyers who have to be in court and so on — that can’t be done remotely.Newer employees, especially recent college grads or those with little experience and lower performers might also fall into this group, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg during an employee town hall Thursday that was broadcast live on his Facebook page. At Facebook, the CEO said employees will have to meet certain criteria to be considered for permanent remote work. This includes a level of seniority, strong performance and, naturally, being part of a team that supports remote work.For now, workers at Facebook, Google, Twitter and elsewhere can work remotely through 2020.CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGEAt Microsoft, employees can work from home until October. But the company’s work-from-home flexibility has fit with the software giant’s broader effort to capitalize on what CEO Satya Nadella calls a shift to “remote everything.”“Every organization will increasingly need the ability at a moment’s notice to remote everything from manufacturing to sales, to customer support,” Nadella said this week at the company’s Build developer conference.The company’s chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, had already been working a lot from home, in part because he is based in Silicon Valley and most of the rest of the leadership team is in Redmond, Wash.“We are all on this accelerated timeline figuring out how to work from home.... It’s learning the culture and the rhythms of interacting with your colleagues by video conference and doing your work remotely,” he said, speaking not just of Microsoft but workplaces in general. “That is getting so much better so quickly that I don’t think I’m going to be commuting nearly as frequently as I was before.”The Associated Press contributed to this report."

"Intense fitness classes can lead to rapid spread of COVID-19, report shows",Coronavirus,Rachael Rettner | LiveScience,2020-05-21,"Fitness dance classes are yet another venue where the new coronavirus appears to easily spread, according to a new report.The report found that dozens of people in South Korea caught COVID-19 after participating in fitness dance classes at the beginning of the pandemic.The researchers traced the cluster back to a workshop that was held for fitness dance instructors in Cheonan, South Korea, on Feb. 15, according to the report, published May 15 in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The workshop involved four hours of intense training, the report said. Among the 27 fitness instructors who participated, eight later tested positive for COVID-19, although none had symptoms on the day of the workshop.Not knowing they had COVID-19, those instructors then went on to teach their own fitness dance classes.By March 9, the researchers had identified 112 COVID-19 cases tied to fitness dance classes at 12 different sports facilities in Cheonan.About half of the cases occurred due to direct transmission from instructors to students during classes, which lasted nearly an hour and met twice a week. The rest of the cases (not including the instructors themselves) occurred due to spread from the students to their family members or coworkers.The researchers noted that the classes involved many people engaging in high-intensity exercise in a small space — a pretty ideal environment for COVID-19 spread.""The moist, warm atmosphere in a sports facility coupled with turbulent air flow generated by intense physical exercise can cause more dense transmission of isolated droplets,"" the authors said.The number of people in a class also appeared to play a role in disease spread: Typical-size classes, with up to 22 participants, resulted in disease spread, while small classes with fewer than five people did not result in any spread of COVID-19, the report found.Interestingly, one of the infected instructors also taught yoga and pilates, but none of these students became infected. The authors hypothesized that the lower intensity of these activities did not result in the same level of transmission as the high-intensity fitness classes.Overall, ""because of the increased possibility of infection through droplets, vigorous exercise in closely confined spaces should be avoided during the current outbreak,"" the authors concluded.Originally published on Live Science."

"Beards evolved so men could take punches to the head, study finds",Style + Beauty,Ben Cost | New York Post,2020-05-21,"Men sporting big bountiful beards might have a reason to feel more confident — and not just because women might be more sexually attracted to guys who can grow them.Research shows that flowing facial hair might have evolved to help fight-hungry humans better absorb blows to the head, according to a new study published in the journal Integrative Organismal Biology. The findings are the culmination of several research projects by the same team on human resilience, including experiments on the ability of the human face to take a punch and the human hands’ efficacy as melee weapons.“We found that fully furred samples were capable of absorbing more energy than plucked and sheared samples,” according to the jaw-dropping experiment conducted by biologists Ethan Beseris, Steven Naleway and David Carrier.Fortunately, no humans were slugged in the name of science. Instead, the team employed an epoxy composite skull covered in several styles of sheep skin — plucked, trimmed, and full-on mutton chops (so to speak). To replicate a punch, they then dropped a weight on the chin, and measured the force via load cell.The scientists found that “peak force was 16 percent greater and total energy absorbed was 37 percent greater in the furred compared to the plucked samples,” per the report.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSpecifically, the tough tufts acted as shock absorbers that dispersed the energy generated by a punch just enough to prevent the fragile jaw from fracturing.Researchers concluded that the beard may function similarly to the mane of a lion or a baboon, “serving to protect vital areas like the throat and jaw from lethal attacks” during a fight.

Financial fallout of COVID-19 hits Montana ranch that helps female veterans fight PTSD,Fox News Flash,Emily DeCiccio,2020-05-21,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.Lisa Ledoux and her mother have been operating Serenity Ranch in Montana since May 2016, providing free equine therapy to female veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other traumas.The economic fallout of COVID-19, however, has taken a toll on Serenity Ranch and is forcing the horse rescue facility to roll back its critical equine therapy programs and sell nearly 40 acres of land.“This year, unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will be unable to do a female veteran program,” said Ledoux. “We’ll be taking care of the horses, and that's kind of what we've been focusing on more lately since the pandemic started, just because the donations that we were receiving have gone down significantly.”Ledoux explained to Fox News that it’s just her and her mom taking care of the ranch and the horses. She broke down the high operating costs and noted that a bale of hay, for example, is $120, and the horses go through one bale in about a day-and-a-half.""The hay cost alone is very pricey, not to mention maintenance of our land, making sure fencing is up to par so horses don't get out,” said Ledoux. “We have to trim our horses’ feet, which is not an easy task either ... and just to do that is about $2,000 to $3,000, so the cost of running the place adds up.”Ledoux and her mother depend on donations to run Serenity Ranch and offer free-of-charge equine therapy to at-risk women. Their dedication comes from their firsthand account of equine therapy when they both experienced loss. When Ledoux’s stepfather died suddenly of a heart attack, they learned how effective working with horses could be when coping with trauma.“The horses are truly healing and they helped us through some really rough times,” said Ledoux. “We wanted to share that, so we established the Serenity Ranch.”A six- to seven-day stay at the ranch includes resilience training with a licensed coach, lessons from a local veterinarian so the women can learn how to tackle first aid issues with the horses, and writing sessions. The women get paired with a horse and they ride that particular horse for the duration of the week.Air Force veteran Cari Simmons explained to Fox News how Serenity Ranch's program impacted her.""Not only was I able to bond with other veterans in magical place of true serenity, the owners and staff at the ranch offered me unconditional acceptance so I could find my voice and confidence again,"" said Simmons. ""On top of that, the herd of magical horses who live on the ranch touched my heart in ways that allowed me to love again — not only them but myself as well. I am so very grateful.""Ledoux and her mother have been rescuing diverse breeds of horses for about 15 years and currently have 41 horses at Serenity Ranch. The mother-daughter duo takes on horses that people may no longer want and also facilitate rescue operations. For example, two years ago, Ledoux and her mother assisted a rescue from a hoarding situation of 40 horses.“That situation was awful, the horses hadn't been cared for or they hadn't been fed, and they hadn't been watered,” said Ledoux. “So we took the 40 horses onto our property, and I am happy to say that most of them have either been homed or adopted.”Ledoux noted that the horses with traumatic pasts truly connect with the women who have suffered trauma themselves, and noted the healing properties of the human-horse connection.“When you're leading a horse, you have to be in the present, and if you're thinking about what you ate for breakfast or thinking about what you were gonna have for lunch or anything, the horses know and will act out,” explained Ledoux. “They might rear up, they might kick, so in order to handle a horse, your brain has to be in a state of complete presence, and you have to be in the moment.”For more on how Serenity Ranch is helping veterans watch the full interview with Serenity Ranch founder Lisa Ledoux above.Emily DeCiccio is a reporter and video producer for Fox News Digital Originals.

Nah — maybe he's never thought that he works for the American people.""The network's chief political anchor Jake Tapper also reacted. ""It seems like an odd thing to worry about given the fact that reporters have been relaying that health officials think it would be a great idea of all leaders across the country to wear them in public,"" he said. ""I don't know why he would not want that image out there.""GOV. ANDREW CUOMO GETS A PASS FROM CNN ON NURSING HOME POLICY CONTROVERSYCNN spent nearly 102 minutes on this issue on Thursday alone, dwarfing the roughly 15 minutes the network dedicated the entire week to a nursing home controversy surrounding Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a case that has at least one state lawmaker calling for a federal probe.CNN'S JAKE TAPPER CALLED OUT FOR HYPOCRISY AFTER SCOLDING TRUMP FOR LAUNCHING 'SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST RIVALS'""It sounds harsh, but CNN has shown that they care more about obsessing over the president not wearing a mask than getting answers for the families of deceased New York nursing home residents,"" NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News. ""If CNN were truly interested in fulfilling their duty in serving the public good and helping to build up a more informed citizenry, they would be grilling the Cuomo administration on their nursing home debacle... Instead, they're melting down over arguably the most-tested man in the world not wearing a mask.""Regarding the network's coronavirus coverage, Houck added, ""If a segment isn't focused on hating the president, decrying reopenings of any kind, or covering for China, it's not worth giving serious thought.""Cuomo recently reversed his March 25 order that forced nursing homes to accept patients who tested positive for coronavirus. Cuomo signed an executive order on May 11 stopping hospitals from sending infected patients back to nursing homes and ramping up testing for staff.More than 4,300 recovering coronavirus patients were sent to New York’s already vulnerable nursing homes under the state directive, according to a count by The Associated Press.Nearly 5,800 people have died from COVID-19 in nursing homes in New York. Roughly 20 percent of all deaths in the state have occurred in nursing homes.CUOMO BROTHERS' JOKEY CNN INTERVIEW IGNORING NURSING HOME CONTROVERSY SPARKS OUTRAGECuomo has largely gotten a pass from CNN as the liberal network has largely refrained from airing critical coverage of the Democratic governor. On Wednesday, he appeared for his tenth interview with his brother, ""Cuomo Prime Time"" anchor Chris Cuomo.As in previous interviews, the CNN anchor made no mention of the growing death toll in New York nursing homes. Yet, he did manage to squeeze in some prop comedy, mocking the governor's televised coronavirus testing examination with overly sized cotton swabs while poking fun at the size of his nose.There was only one mention of nursing homes during the entire interview, when Gov. Cuomo was boasting about the state's increased coronavirus testing capabilities and listed nursing homes and prisons among the sites that they have been administered.MSNBC'S STEPHANIE RUHLE SLAMMED FOR 'SOFTBALL INTERVIEW' WITH CUOMO AMID NURSING HOME CONTROVERSY""CNN's coverage of Andrew Cuomo has been consistent with much of the media, focus on the glowing verbiage and ignore the catastrophic mishandling of nursing homes that led to thousands of deaths,” Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson told Fox News.“This problem is compounded by a serious conflict of interest arising from the relationship between Chris Cuomo, one of CNN's highest-profile news personalities, and his brother the Governor,” Jacobson added. “Chris Cuomo should not be allowed to cover or comment on air about his brother, and CNN should appoint someone to monitor and review coverage of Andrew Cuomo to prevent this conflict of interest from bleeding over to other news coverage.”Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean told ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" Thursday that Cuomo's failed nursing home policy should be ""one of the biggest"" stories of the year after both of her parents-in-law lost their lives to the coronavirus.""I have not seen the coverage of this ... ,"" an emotional Dean said.

"Rep. Roger Marshall, M.D.: WHO desperately needs reform – here’s how to protect global health now",OPINION,"Rep. Roger Marshall, M.D.",2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.For the last 70 years, the U.S. and countries around the world have put their trust in the World Health Organization (WHO) to alert the global community of disease outbreaks and provide technical expertise in public health. In return, the WHO has – time and again – demonstrated its systemic organizational problems and lack of accountability.The COVID-19 pandemic is just one more example of the WHO’s willingness to let politics govern over their core responsibility as a global public health watchdog.As a physician, I’m especially concerned about the WHO’s failure to properly respond to these outbreaks. Nearly 100,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, and this international health organization must be held to strict medical and information sharing standards going forward.AVELLA AND DUGAN: GEORGIA VS. CORONAVIRUS — THESE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCEDecisions by the WHO guide and impact the abilities of medical providers to provide proper guidance and care for their patients.The director-general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom, made several disastrous mistakes in mitigating and preventing the COVID-19 outbreak. On Jan. 14, the Chinese government denied human-to-human transmission of the virus was occurring, and the WHO quickly endorsed their message. It’s shocking that the WHO made no attempt to independently verify the claims of an undemocratic government widely known for its iron muzzle on the media, the “Great Firewall” of Internet controls, and an unapologetic history of concealing the truth.Then again, this easy solidarity with China is no surprise when considering Tedros was largely backed by China when seeking the WHO’s top position. More notably, his home country is one of Africa’s leading partners for China’s “Belt and Road Initiative” and China remains their largest source of foreign investment.Politics, unfortunately, had much to do with the Tedros decision to state that the Chinese response to the outbreak was “transparent” and had his full confidence. As Tedros was helping the Chinese government, hospitals across Wuhan became overwhelmed by sick patients while Chinese officials silenced the medical community with one hand, and stockpiled personal protective equipment with the other.However, thanks to unwavering international pressure, Tedros declared the outbreak a public health emergency and changed course.It is time to reevaluate the organizational structure of the WHO to ensure future responses are based on science, not propaganda.It’s doubtful the WHO would have reacted differently without Tedros catering to China. This isn’t the organization’s first failure at responding to a disease outbreak. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic sparked heavy criticism of the WHO’s poor performance and prompted many external and internal investigations calling for reform. While some reform measures have been adopted, WHO continues to lack accountability, and without it, medical expertise and public health will always come second to politics and propaganda.Independent investigations of the COVID-19 outbreak will undoubtedly be written and recommendations for reform will be outlined. Minor technical changes will be adopted and the ones threatening political favor will be ignored. In order to ensure meaningful changes are actually made, countries need to abandon the carrot and grab the stick.The U.S. is the largest volunteer contributor to the WHO, and with these persistent problems, the Trump administration rightly decided to halt funding pending an investigation into its handling of the COVID-19 outbreak.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERAs the Trump administration continues to pry open political motivations driving the WHO, over 60 countries, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, as well as the European Union, have signed a resolution backing the investigation. That resolution was recently adopted unanimously during a virtual meeting of the World Health Assembly, despite repeated complaints from China.It is time to reevaluate the organizational structure of the WHO to ensure future responses are based on science, not propaganda.Participating countries should consider establishing a small select voting body of medical experts, similar to the structure of the United Nations Security Council, with the purpose of championing cooperation in solving global health issues. This body could oversee significant policy issues like outbreaks, major capital expenditures, and assess actions taken by other countries during public health emergencies.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAccountability comes with the power to make decisions that member states are then obligated to implement. This would be supplemented with international pressure.The U.S. — the largest single provider of humanitarian assistance, the largest contributor to the WHO, and global watchdog — must lead this fight to ensure the WHO fulfills its role in global health and pandemic response.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP.

Rep. Brian Mast: Memorial Day and my fallen friends show us how to thrive after coronavirus,OPINION,Rep. Brian Mast | Fox News,2020-05-21,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.The coronavirus pandemic has confronted our nation with many unique challenges. For the first time in our storied history, Americans were asked to not go to work, to not hustle and to not exhaust ourselves.Now, we are presented with an equal number of questions about how to move forward and re-open. How does America recover? How do we press forward? And how do we move on from the collapse of the routine that has always driven us on?I believe that Memorial Day can help provide the answer to these questions.MICHAEL LEVIN: AFTER CORONAVIRUS, HOW WILL YOU ANSWER THIS IMPORTANT QUESTION?Memorial Day gives us answers because we can reflect and seek spiritual guidance from the most selfless our country has ever known. We look to their grit. We ask ourselves what they would tell us to do and how would they ask us to revere the freedom they gave their last breath to provide.While they are no longer here to share what they learned in person, their stories leave us with lessons that are especially important in times where our country is challenged with adversity.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTEREach week when I fly into Washington, D.C., I see the beautiful white crosses and Stars of David of Arlington National Cemetery from above. When my young boys, Magnum and Maverick, are with me we tour the seemingly endless Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the larger-than-life steel statues of the Korean War Memorial, or the expansive World War II Memorial. In my opinion, there are none from whom we can learn more than these heroes who gave it all so that we may live free.Gracing the walls of the building that houses my office are the names of each fallen brother and sister from my war. Each day, as I pass through the entrance, I see the faces of those I knew, and each time my eye catches a heading for all lost in a given month and year my mind replays conversations had with so many fallen friends.The etching of their names reminds us of their commitment to the fight and the way nothing would ever stop them.Every time, I wonder if we are worthy of their sacrifice. Just as each soldier strives to prove themselves each day of service, I believe my fallen friends would want each civilian to strive to prove themselves each day of free life. In that, I believe, lies the answer to how our country recovers from this crisis.So, this Memorial Day, I am reflecting on the sacrifice of my friends — that I served with, took fire with, climbed mountains in Afghanistan with, disarmed bombs with and took it to America’s enemies with — and the lessons we can learn from them:Americans are never victims. If we wake up under the flag they charged into battle with then we wake up getting to decide that today will be a better day than yesterday and that this week will be better than last week.I believe Staff Sgt. Eric Trueblood (KIA 03/10/2011) would remind us that we are not measured by what we do when something is a walk in the park. Rather, we get measured when we face something that seems impossible.I believe Staff Sgt. David Day (KIA 04/24/2011) would tell us that the tougher the times, the tougher the people get built.Sgt. Justin Allen (KIA 07/18/2010) was never one to feel sorry for himself, so I believe he would take on the challenge with everything he’s got — not once complaining.Sgt. Anibal Santiago (KIA 07/18/2010) would probably challenge everybody — in language that isn’t fit to print — to have the courage to get out and live their lives.I believe Senior Chief Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician Craig Vickers (KIA 08/06/2011) would remind us—in excruciating detail—that, no matter what we do, every minute still has 60 seconds, each hour still has 60 minutes and each day is still going to take 24 of those. We shouldn’t let time pass us by trying to evade life’s challenges.I believe Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician Second Class Petty Officer Tyler Trahan (KIA 04/01/2009) would keep it simple: keep going no matter what, he might say.I believe Capt. Kyle Comfort (KIA 05/08/2010) would remind us that even knowing every possible detail about the coronavirus that there is to know, there is still going to be risk.I believe Doc Jonathan Peney (KIA 06/01/2010) would tell us that not even training to be safe is safe.I believe Sgt. Tanner Higgins (KIA 04/14/2012) would tell us not to waste a moment of this precious life that we have the privilege to live.I believe Sgt. Andrew Nicol (KIA 08/08/2010) would probably say that he didn’t live in tents, cargo ship containers, mud huts and swamps so the people he fought for can curl up and hide.Finally, I believe Sgt. 1st Class Lance Vogeler (KIA 10/01/2010) — one of my closest friends and who I would undoubtedly turn to for advice if he were still here — would share with me a couple lessons. Seek the positive in the negative, he would say. Commitment to life is not about the quantity of minutes we get but about the way we spend the minutes we have and how we effect those in our path.A massive quantity of his minutes were spent in combat fighting for us. He was killed during his 12th deployment, just days after I was taken off the battlefield by an improvised explosive device.Each Memorial Day I am given a renewed commitment to honor his sacrifice and the sacrifice of all those who were laid to rest beneath our beautiful flag of 50 stars and 13 red and white stripes. This Memorial Day, they all remind me that we are not made of glass and we don’t just break when we fall.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPI hope our nation can learn from them. We have been challenged by COVID-19, but Americans are never victims. If we wake up under the flag they charged into battle with then we wake up getting to decide that today will be a better day than yesterday and that this week will be better than last week. If we do not actively work to make it that way then we squander the life and freedom they gave everything to defend.So, for those honored by the slow hum of Taps, I pray that this Memorial Day the crack of their 21-gun salute can be so jarring that it wakes up the world.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP.

Dems make big push to aid illegal immigrants amid coronavirus crisis,Illegal Immigrants,Adam Shaw,2020-05-22,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.Congressional Democrats and state governments are pushing a range of ways to assist illegal immigrants in their response to the coronavirus crisis, calling for the release of those in detention and lobbying to make them eligible for over a thousand dollars each in stimulus payments.President Trump, for his part, has responded to the crisis by cracking down on both illegal and legal immigration — slapping travel bans on China, Iran and the European Union and limiting entry on land borders to the north and south, while border officials are immediately returning illegal immigrants and asylum seekers to their home countries.HOUSE DEMOCRATS' CORONAVIRUS PACKAGE INCLUDES 'AMNESTY' FOR SOME ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, CRITICS SAYDemocrats, however, are taking the opposite approach. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., have introduced a bill that would release immigrants in detention into the country, and halt any immigration enforcement against anyone not deemed a “significant” threat to public safety.“We have an obligation to do everything we can to prevent the spread of this deadly disease, and that means moving people out of detention centers when they do not pose a public safety risk,” Booker said in a statement. “This is really a matter of life and death: it’s time that we act quickly and decisively to save as many lives as possible, and that means ending the unnecessary detention of immigrants during this public health crisis.”Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Democrats are demanding that the next round of stimulus checks include illegal immigrants by modifying a requirement that recipients have a Social Security number to receive one.DRUG CARTELS AT THE BORDER TRYING TO 'EXPLOIT' CORONAVIRUS CRISIS, CBP CHIEF SAYSA $3 trillion bill passed by the Democratic-controlled House last week would allow the $1,200 stimulus checks to go to those who also pay income taxes via an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) — which is used by people who are ineligible for a Social Security number, including illegal immigrants.As partial justification, Democrats have pointed to so-called mixed families, in which there are American citizens or legal permanent residents, as well as illegal immigrants, in one family. They file using an ITIN and so far have not been eligible for aid.“The Supreme Court ruled that children, undocumented children should have a right to education in our country. Why not then should citizens’ children, children in taxpayers’ families, not have the opportunity to the checks that they need?” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on a press call this month.But it’s an idea that has drawn strong criticism, even mockery, from Republicans who believe that aid should be reserved only to citizens and those here legally.“Can you believe it? We forgot to have the Treasury Department send money to people here illegally. My goodness. What an oversight,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor last week.The bill also included protections for “essential critical infrastructure workers” that would allow some illegal immigrants employed as such to be placed into “a period of deferred action” and be authorized to work if they meet certain conditions.It also grants protections to those employers who hire illegal immigrants, stating that “the hiring, employment or continued employment” of the defined group of illegal immigrants is not in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act.The move was flagged by Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli as a push by Democrats to grant ""amnesty"" to illegal immigrants and protection to those who employ them.“Is it really a good idea to not only grant an amnesty to illegal aliens but to absolve employers who have been breaking the law in the last few months?” he tweeted. “I don't think so!”SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL CALLS FOR $100 MILLION 'RELIEF FUND' FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTSMeanwhile, some state governments have been seeking to make sure illegal immigrants receive money and argue they should have been included in the last round of stimulus.The Seattle City Council is calling on Washington state to create a $100 million “relief fund” for illegal immigrants who did not qualify for the federal stimulus checks issued last month.The city’s council passed a resolution Monday asking Gov. Jay Inslee to create a “Washington Worker Relief Fund” to provide “economic assistance to undocumented Washingtonians during the COVID-19 pandemic.”Meanwhile in California, the state has opened up about $75 million for a fund to help roughly 150,000 illegal immigrants in the state.
