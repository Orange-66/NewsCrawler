Are lockdowns being relaxed in my state? Here's how America is reopening amid the coronavirus pandemic.,HEALTH,Joel Shannon,2020-04-19,"As state governments continue to unveil a patchwork of plans to gradually reopen the American economy, the question that looms in the coming weeks is whether increased resident mobility leads to a surge in new coronavirus cases.And that question will likely be answered soon. The majority of states are moving forward with phased-in approaches that often vary by county and city.Texas could be a telling case. The state became one of the first to take aggressive measures, allowing restaurants and retailers to reopen to limited customer capacity May 1. Last week, on May 14, Texas reported its highest single-day increase of new cases, with 1,448, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard.By Saturday, that mark swelled to 1,801. Just in Amarillo, a city in North Texas whose population is a shade under 200,000, there were more than 700 new cases Saturday.That prompted Gov. Greg Abbott to release a statement that said as Texas ""continues ramping up its testing capabilities, there will be an increase in positive cases as the state targets the most high-risk areas.""The administration of President Donald Trump has pivoted to a three-phase plan that leaves the decision to reopen the economy to states, creating an uneven strategy that some health experts warn could undermine the progress that has been made in stemming the spread of coronavirus.Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned May 12 in a Senate committee hearing that reopening the country amid the coronavirus may lead to ""some suffering and death.""Get daily coronavirus updates in your inbox:Sign up for our newsletter nowU.S. coronavirus map:Track how the outbreak has spread in your stateThis week, almost half of the 50 states are lightening restrictions in some form. We will keep this file updated as measures are announced:AlabamaGov. Kay Ivey loosened coronavirus restrictions effective May 11, allowing limited operations of restaurants, hair and nail salons, and gyms.Restaurants, bars and breweries may open with limited table seating. Restaurants must limit tables to eight people and maintain six-foot distances between dining groups. The establishments are urged to offer curbside service.Gyms, athletic facilities and hair and nail salon providers also opened ""subject to social-distancing and sanitation rules and guidelines."" Gyms are forbidden from offering sports that require close contact with others or sharing sporting apparatus and equipment. They must also limit capacity to 50%.The order also removed a 10-person restriction on nonwork gatherings. That will allow churches to resume regular services.Previously, Ivey loosened some restrictions on retail operations, and said the state would monitor the situation to decide what further steps could be taken.AlaskaLife is going back to the way it was ""prior to the virus"" on May 22, Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced.All businesses – including restaurants, bars, retail stores and gyms – will be allowed to open without any capacity restrictions and without needing to provide hand sanitizer or enforcing social distancing guidelines.Previously, Dunleavy and state officials had issued a number of health orders as a part of the phased Reopen Alaska Responsibly Plan.

To do so, they are required to limit occupancy and physically distance diners, in addition to checking employees for COVID-19 symptoms before their shifts.ArkansasPools and water parks can reopen in May with new capacity limits and other restrictions, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said May 8.Arkansas restaurants were also able to reopen their dining rooms on May 11 with restrictions.Dental services resumed May 11.

Los Angeles County, the most populated in the state, has targeted July 4 for a fuller reopening.On May 20, Ventura County, which has been under stay-at-home orders since mid-March, became the first county in Southern California to be approved for accelerated reopening.Los Angeles County reopened its beaches May 13 for “active recreation,” and similar moves were announced for several beaches along Ventura County's south coast.Newsom has repeatedly said counties can impose restrictions that are more stringent than state orders. In mid-May, Tesla's car plant reopened, defying orders from the Alameda County Public Health Department, which has deemed the factory a nonessential business that can’t fully open under virus restrictions.ColoradoCamping in state parks resume by reservation only on May 12, Gov. Jared Polis said. Counties can decide independently if they do not want to reopen camping in state parks within their boundaries.Polis said officials expect to have more data about how the coronavirus is being transmitted on May 25, giving them ""more data to make the call"" on next steps for restaurants, summer camps and spring skiing.Offices deemed nonessential were allowed to reopen May 4 with reduced staff. Current restrictions allow curbside retail and real estate showings. Getting a haircut and shopping in person at retail stores were allowed again in much of Colorado starting May 1 as the state eased restrictions.Denver lifted its stay-home restrictions on the weekend of May 9, and Polis said state officials would be paying close attention to potential health impacts.One week before the state's stay-at-home order lifted April 27, Polis announced the next phase, called ""safer at home"": The goal is for Coloradans to maintain 60% to 65% social distancing, and vulnerable residents should continue to shelter in place.Schools will remain closed, and bars and restaurants will not immediately reopen.Colorado hospitals, dental offices, optometrists and other health care providers could start seeing patients for elective procedures again by early May.ConnecticutThe Constitution State took its first steps toward a return to normalcy on May 20, as offices, retail stores, malls, restaurants (for outdoor dining), outdoor museums and zoos are now open.But, Gov.

John Carney announced that all retail establishments in Delaware may operate by appointment only beginning May 20.Gov. Carney earlier had announced that arts facilities, retail stores, malls, barbershops and hair salons, exercise facilities, tanning salons, casinos and racetracks and food/drink establishments can reopen with strict requirements on June 1.At restaurants, breweries and bars that offer table service, guests must be given single-use, paper disposable menus.

Ron DeSantis said May 15 that people who are healthier are less likely to die from the coronavirus, which is part of his rationale to include gyms as the state expands the first phase of its reopening.Beginning May 18, the state also increased restrictions on restaurant and retail store capacity from 25% to 50%, as well as allowing the reopening of museums, libraries and gyms at 50% capacity. Bars and movie theaters will remain closed.On May 20, the state's biggest tourist destination – Walt Disney World – began its reopening by opening its shopping and entertainment complex (but not the park itself.)On May 14, DeSantis signed an executive order to move Miami-Dade County and Broward County – both of which are the hardest hit in the state – into Phase One of his reopening plan.Beaches in the two counties will remain closed. Miami, Miami Beach and Hialeah – Miami-Dade’s bigger cities – will allow retailers to reopen May 20 and restaurants to open, likely, the following week.The counties account for almost half of the state's confirmed virus cases.Both Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez and Broward County Mayor Dale Holness said that when beaches do open in their counties, they will be at the same time to avoid people flocking to one location. Beaches will not open until at least May 26, Holness said.DeSantis allowed hair stylists, barbers and nail technicians to reopen, he announced May 8. In mid-May, DeSantis signaled the state's openness to pro sports returning..GeorgiaGov. Brian Kemp on May 12 announced plans to relax some restaurant restrictions and allow some summer camps to open but extend bar and nightclub closures through May.Kemp allowed businesses such as tattoo parlors, bowling alleys and hair and nail salons to reopen with restrictions in late April, a sweeping move that prompted national criticism. Restaurants and movie theaters have since been able to welcome customers back in on a limited basis, and a statewide shelter-at-home order has expired.Some malls reopened May 4, though things were far from normal with many businesses inside still shuttered and parking lots sparsely filled.Kemp allowed his statewide shelter-in-place order to expire at midnight April 30 but extended his emergency powers to June 12 and told the elderly and medically fragile to stay at home until then.In-person religious services resumed over the April 25-26 weekend, and restaurants and theaters reopenedon April 27 with ""specific social distancing and sanitation mandates.""HawaiiGov.

Brad Little allowed his five-week stay-at-home order to expire April 30. Idaho residents have been successful at reducing infections and deaths, Little said.On May 14, Little gave the go-ahead to begin stage two of reopening Idaho as scheduled on May 16. That meant that dine-in restaurants, nail and hair salons, and gyms began reopening on May 16.On May 1, the state entered the first of his four-stage plan to recover from the economic damage caused by the virus. Little said the process will take time, and advancing through the stages to return the state to near normalcy by the end of June will be based on declining infections and strong testing. The readiness of the health care system is another factor.Child-care centers were able to reopen May 1. Churches also reopened with distancing and sanitation rules. Bars, gyms, salons, movie theaters and sporting venues remain closed. Restaurants can offer curbside and delivery service.IllinoisGov. J.B.

The metrics include a 14-day decline of hospitalizations, a 14-day decline of hospitalized deaths, new hospitalizations to drop to under two per 100,000 residents and a share of total hospital beds available of at least 30%, among others.Cuomo also announced that New York reopened statewide certain low-risk businesses and recreational activities on May 15, including landscaping and gardening, outdoor low-risk recreational activities like tennis and drive-in movie theaters.Religious gatherings limited to 10 people were allowed to resume May 21, the New York Times said.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said May 11 that closures of nonessential businesses are likely to extend in the city through May.“June is when we’re potentially going to be able to make some real changes if we can continue our progress,” de Blasio said.New York has extended some executive orders but still hasn't decided on how long it would extend its stay-at-home order, Cuomo's office said.New York’s schools and colleges will remain shut through the end of the academic year, Cuomo said.The state updated its guidance for golf courses, opening the door for public and private courses to open.

In the first tier are construction, mining, computing, agriculture and manufacturing. Rather than provide specific target dates for the stages, it recommended enacting each by monitoring the rate of transmission on the island.On May 1, Vázquez Garced extended a lockdown order through May 25. It allows residents to leave their homes only from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. for essential activities. After 7 p.m., a daily curfew goes into effect until the following morning.

The closure on beaches will be lifted, though it will be up to local officials to decide on the reopening of specific beaches.The order still encourages social distancing directives to be followed.

Home offices are expensive: Study says most people didn't have one before coronavirus,MONEY,Dalvin Brown,2020-05-18,"Stephanie Silva didn't have a proper home office set up before the coronavirus pandemic, so the transition to remote work from her Orange County, California, home over the past couple of months was ""surprisingly expensive.""During most of April, the HR assistant sat on the floor and worked from her personal laptop. But with the COVID-19 shutdown extending into May, she and her boyfriend invested in a more comfortable setup.They ordered a desk from Wayfair, an office chair from Amazon, ink for the printer and other home office staples. In total, they spent more than $600.""It all added up quickly,"" Silva said. ""I had no idea it would cost this much.""Silva is far from the only person scrambling to piece together a home office in the stay-at-home era, and setting one up from scratch isn't cheap.In fact, most people (54%) didn't have a remote work setup before the government moved to curb nonessential gatherings, according to a survey conducted by YouGov in partnership with USA TODAY and LinkedIn. Meanwhile, 74% of professionals age 18 to 74 said they're now working from home.Supermarket spending:April grocery store prices made highest jump in more than 40 yearsBye-bye butterfly keyboard:Apple unveils 13-inch MacBook Pro with a better typing experienceWhile remote work cuts down on the cost of commuting, home offices come with other sets of expenses.People who are used to endlessly charging their laptops and other devices at the corporate office are now facing higher household electricity bills. Then, there's the expense of office furniture and reliable Wi-Fi. You may even feel pushed to invest in a printer or extra monitors.But do companies have to reimburse you for any of these?""It's tricky,"" said Lara Shortz, a labor attorney at Michelman & Robinson. ""But it largely depends on the state you live in.""Several states such as California, Illinois, Minnesota and South Dakota have laws that require some sort of reimbursement for necessary work-related expenses. That means companies are more likely to cover the cost of hardware that you need to fulfill your job, like a computer or laptop, Shortz said.Upgrades to your home internet typically wouldn't qualify for reimbursement under state laws, Shortz added.Nearly a third of those working from home (32%) have had their calls or video chats interrupted by Wi-Fi or technology challenges, the study with LinkedIn and YouGov found. Some people are paying for more internet bandwidth to overcome these issues.Johanna Appel, an elementary school teacher in Long Island, New York, upgraded her home internet plan to accommodate an influx of Zoom calls with dozens of faculty members and students.Her job provided her with a Chromebook laptop, though it wasn't powerful enough, she said. She spent nearly $2,000 on a Dell HP desktop, a set of headphones and a printer since the school closed its doors in mid-March.""I had to do it for my sanity,"" Appel said. ""I think the money was worth being spent, but I don't think I'll get reimbursed at all.""If you use part of your home for business, you may be able to deduct some of the expenses when you file your taxes. The IRS website says the home office deduction is available for both homeowners and renters.Not everyone can afford a comfy work setup at home. Internet providers like AT&T and Comcast have offered incentives to ease the burden. And not everyone has space to fit a work desk. But experts have tips for using what you do have.A quality pair of headphones is a simple way to help you focus on your tasks by reducing the noise you hear around you, according to Madeline Pratt, founder of the technology consulting agency Fearless in Training.""With people having kids, dogs and partners at home, getting a really good headset situation is critical to be clear and focused on calls,"" Pratt said.You don't necessarily need to buy a desk in order to look professional on Zoom calls, said LinkedIn career expert Blair Heitmann. Just ""avoid couches, beds and cozy chairs that put your posture in a more relaxed position,"" Heitmann said.These days, coworkers are understanding when it comes to occasional interruptions from kids or pets. Still, finding a dedicated space to work that's free from unnecessary distractions is essential.""Try to find a place that is set apart from the rest of your family with a door,"" Heitmann said.

"The 20 best movie series to binge during quarantine (including 'Star Wars,' of course)",MOVIES,Brian Truitt,2020-04-29,"You've got extra time in self-isolation. We've got a bunch of movie series for you to watch.After you've binged ""Tiger King"" like everybody else, maybe it's time to tuck into a film franchise, be it something beloved or a completely new experience. (When all this is over, no one can ever admit that they've never seen a ""Star Wars"" or a Marvel movie again.)Thankfully, Hollywood's penchant for sequels, prequels and reboots has wrought a plethora of big-time trilogies and collections where you can dive in head first for a new project. For those wanting to watch every James Bond film, well, that's like a full-time job.For those who are game, here are the best 20 film series to watch, with advice on the most must-see individual chapters as well as the skippable entries.Need a coronavirus escape? Here are 100 movies to watch for every cinematic yearningStaying Apart, Together:A newsletter about how to cope with the coronavirus pandemic‘Alien’The always-evolving franchise mixing sci-fi and horror has kept things interesting since 1979, giving us a legendary heroine in Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in the early films and an all-time creature design in H.R. Giger’s Xenomorph.Be sure to see: Ridley Scott’s original “Alien” and James Cameron’s 1986 “Aliens” are equally astounding, the former being a claustrophobic chiller in space and the latter an impressive action epic.But feel free to skip: The “Alien vs. Predator” movies are atrocious, and 1997’s “Alien Resurrection” went some weird places with cloning Ripley.Where to watch: iTunes, Vudu, FandangoNOW‘Back to the Future’You’d be hard-pressed to name a time-traveling series more influential or more referenced as Michael J. Fox’s trilogy of trips to 1955, 2015 (back when that was still the far-flung future) and 1885.Be sure to see: The original is still the best, as Fox’s Marty McFly has to go to the past to make sure his parents fall in love – and deal with his mom (Lea Thompson) hitting on him.But feel free to skip: There is definitely a case of gradually diminishing returns in the last two movies, though the wrap-up of the Western-flavored “Back to the Future III"" still works.Where to watch: iTunes, Vudu, FandangoNOW‘The Dark Knight’ trilogyBeginning with “Batman Begins,” the series helmed by Christopher Nolan gave the iconic Caped Crusader grit and depth, an outstanding actor in Christian Bale, plus Heath Ledger’s all-time portrayal as the Joker.Be sure to see: Ledger arrives in the second chapter, “The Dark Knight,” to lend madness and mayhem to a story ultimately about finding humanity amid pure chaos.But feel free to skip: Even with a masked Tom Hardy as Bane, the concluding “Dark Knight Rises” is a letdown. (Though it’s “Citizen Kane” compared with George Clooney’s “Batman & Robin.”)Where to watch: iTunes, Vudu, FandangoNOW‘The Conjuring’Horror history is chock full of memorable series (“Friday the 13th,” “Halloween”) and director James Wan’s freaky mythology based on the exploits of real-life paranormal investigators is a haven of recent fright fests.Be sure to see: The two main “Conjuring” films (starring Patrick Warren and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren) are the primary culprits in doling out chills, especially the 2016 sequel with some serious “Exorcist” vibes.But feel free to skip: The spinoffs have been a mixed bag, and the worst is “The Nun,” a 1950s-set prequel that completely wastes its demonic leading lady of the cloth.Where to watch: iTunes, Vudu, FandangoNOW‘Die Hard’Bruce Willis’ John McClane was a breath of fresh air when he showed up in 1988, a relatable action hero who had all sorts of craziness thrown at him, only to get back up with a witty retort and gumption to spare.Be sure to see: The original “Die Hard” is a towering action film that doubles as one of the best Christmas movies ever.But feel free to skip: The other four installments are all over the place, though the low point is “A Good Day to Die Hard,” which rolled out Jai Courtney as McClane’s son.Where to watch: iTunes, Vudu, FandangoNOW‘Fast & Furious’The muscle-bound action series has gifted us with nine testosterone-fueled extravaganzas, as Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his car-loving crew have gone from vehicle-jacking hoods to world-saving good guys.Be sure to see: After four somewhat lackluster films, the “Furious” films really revved into gear with the addition of “franchise viagra” Dwayne Johnson in “Fast Five.”But feel free to skip: Not counting Johnson’s spinoff “Hobbs & Shaw,” “2 Fast 2 Furious” is the only “Fast” movie without Diesel.

Majority of Democrats, Republicans say they haveDespite high-profile incidents of Americans refusing to wear face masks, an overwhelming majority of Americans say they have worn a face covering due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey.More than four out of five Americans — 84% — said they have worn a mask in public in an effort to limit the spread of coronavirus, according to a survey from the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project.And while reopening economies and wearing a mask have at times become partisan talking points, the vast majority of Democrats and Republicans said they have worn a mask in public.There is a small disparity among age groups, with younger people having been slightly less likely to have worn a mask in public.

How American meat plants bred coronavirus hot spotsThe meatpacking industry faces perhaps its greatest test of worker safety, as the novel coronavirus continues to sweep through its slaughterhouses and processing plants.As of May 20, officials have publicly linked at least 15,300 COVID-19 infections to 192 U.S. meatpacking plants, according to tracking by the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting. At least 63 workers have died.The meatpacking industry has evolved into a marvel of modern efficiency, producing 105 billion pounds of meat annually, but those same features that allow a steady churn of cheap meat also provide the perfect breeding ground for airborne diseases like the coronavirus: a cramped workplace, a culture of underreporting illnesses, and a cadre of rural, immigrant and undocumented workers who share transportation and close living quarters.“This pandemic is preying on decades of the fundamental arrangement of how we produce our food,"" said Joshua Specht, an assistant professor of history at the University of Notre Dame who studies the meat industry.– Sky Chadde, Kyle Bagenstose, Veronica Martinez Jacobo and Rachel AxonMore on America's food chain:When businesses shut down, truckers lost work, risked their health to keep America openFDA investigates lab as COVID-19 test results in Florida questionedFederal regulators are investigating a Texas laboratory that a Florida hospital chain dropped last week because of delayed and unreliable COVID-19 test results.AdventHealth, which has 45 hospitals in nine states, terminated its Florida contract with MicroGen DX due to concerns about the validity of some of the 60,000 tests MicroGen had processed for the system because the lab did not store them according to CDC guidelines, AdventHealth said in a statement.AdventHealth said it is notifying about 25,000 patients who got unreliable or delayed results. It is advising them to seek medical care and retesting if they tested negative but have COVID symptoms. Patients who tested positive should also seek retesting, AdventHealth said. It told the lab to destroy remaining tests and said its patients who haven’t received results from MicroGen DX will never receive them.The dispute is expected to affect testing across the U.S. as MicroGen had an undisclosed number of other clients.– Bailey Gallion and Jayne O'DonnellCaesars Palace, Flamingo will be first hotels to reopen on Las Vegas StripCaesars Entertainment, operator of nine properties in Las Vegas, has not unveiled when it will reopen because it's up to state and local officials controlling shutdown orders. But the company on Thursday granted a peek of what tourists can expect from the resort giant when Las Vegas reopens.Rather than opening all properties at the same time, the chain will first welcome guests to Caesars Palace and the Flamingo Las Vegas. “Reopening Las Vegas in a phased approach will be a significant milestone for Caesars Entertainment as the country continues to emerge from this necessary closure period,” said Tony Rodio, CEO of Caesars Entertainment in a statement.Both Caesars Palace and the Flamingo will offer hotel rooms, dining options and access to pools – as well as slot machines and table games.

"Cheap chicken, beef came at a cost. How American meat plants bred coronavirus hot spots.",None,,2020-05-21,"Maria cut chicken thighs shoulder to shoulder with co-workers who coughed and ran fevers.The 33-year-old single mother from Mexico worked on a fast-paced line in one of America’s most dangerous industries. Meatpacking plants have long faced criticism for sacrificing worker safety in the name of efficiency and cheap meat. Injuries are common: Severed fingers. Chemical exposure. Back sprains.But Maria, who asked to be identified only by her first name because of employment concerns, feared something worse while slicing a steady stream of carcasses in mid-April at the Mountaire Farms poultry facility in Siler City, North Carolina.As the novel coronavirus invaded meatpacking plants across the nation, infecting dozens — then hundreds, then thousands — of workers, Maria said she feared for her life. Every time a colleague coughed, she said, she wondered if COVID-19 had found its way to Mountaire.She worried about getting sick and dying, leaving her children without a mother. Maria said her plant supervisors wouldn’t talk about it. So she kept working.By late April, the company confirmed at least 11 employees had tested positive for the virus. One of them was a co-worker, Maria said, who called her upset that she unwittingly passed the virus to her father and he died.The meatpacking industry has evolved into a marvel of modern efficiency, producing 105 billion pounds annually of poultry, pork, beef and lamb destined for dinner tables across America and the world. That’s nearly double what it produced three decades ago.But its evolution came at a cost. The same features that allow a steady churn of cheap meat also provide the perfect breeding ground for airborne diseases like the coronavirus: a cramped workplace, a culture of underreporting illnesses, and a cadre of rural, immigrant and undocumented workers who share transportation and close living quarters.“This pandemic is preying on decades of the fundamental arrangement of how we produce our food,"" said Joshua Specht, an assistant professor of history at the University of Notre Dame who studies the meat industry.The meatpacking industry now faces perhaps its greatest test of worker safety, as the novel coronavirus continues to sweep through its slaughterhouses and processing plants.As of May 20, officials have publicly linked at least 15,300 COVID-19 infections to 192 U.S. meatpacking plants, according to tracking by the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting. At least 63 workers have died.In April, USA TODAY found that 1 in 3 of the nation's 405 largest meatpacking plants operated in a county with a high rate of COVID-19 infections. This week, the data shows that trend has expanded to more than half of those plants.Companies including Tyson, Smithfield and JBS have implemented measures meant to reduce exposure, with many installing plastic sheeting between workers on the line, providing masks and face shields to employees and taking temperatures daily. Some have offered more generous sick leave.“They’ve been impressed with how much we’ve done,” Tim Schellpeper, the president of JBS’ beef business, told the Austin American-Statesman about workers’ reaction to coronavirus-protection measures taken inside the company’s pork plant in tiny Cactus, Texas.“It’s probably safer in these plants than it is in the communities,” added Shane Miller, senior vice president and general manager of beef enterprise for Tyson Fresh Meats in an interview with the Statesman, part of the USA TODAY Network.Dozens of plants, including those owned by JBS and Tyson, have closed for days or weeks to slow or stop the spread of the virus.Tyson Foods installed plastic barriers between worker stations at its meat and poultry plants to protect against transmission of the coronavirus. Tyson FoodsWhen federal guidelines for preventing the spread of coronavirus in meat and poultry plants came out in April, “companies immediately worked those procedures, practices and methods into their processes,” said Sarah Little, a spokeswoman for the North American Meat Institute.“And now we have CDC, USDA, OSHA, and the state and local officials working together to ensure that the facilities are doing everything possible to protect employees.”But some say the measures are too little, too late in an industry where worker safety has always been at risk.Rantoul Foods' pork plant outside Champaign, Illinois, took some of the same precautions as Tyson, Smithfield and JBS and still succumbed to a coronavirus outbreak.Prompted by complaints from plant workers, county health inspectors toured the Rantoul plant in late April and found employees standing shoulder to shoulder with no barriers or rushing in and out of break rooms. They crowded at sinks, which often lacked hot water. Many didn’t wear masks over their mouths and noses.Rantoul Foods in Rantoul, Ill., had an outbreak of coronavirus in May. Darrell Hoemann/Midwest Center for Investigative ReportingThe plant, which at the time knew of just one COVID-19 case among its employees, responded to the findings by hiring one person per shift to ensure workers properly wore masks. It also adjusted people on the line to social distance, set up break rooms outside and staggered lunch and break times, according to an email a Rantoul executive sent to the health department.It was not enough.Since the inspection, at least 87 Rantoul workers have tested positive for COVID-19. That’s nearly a quarter of the cases in Champaign County, which had a total of 435 positive tests as of Wednesday, according to the state’s health department.With an outbreak in progress, the plant then reduced line speeds to half capacity, according to a company statement. And Rantoul is “currently exploring the use of barriers between line employees to be in place before we ramp production speeds back up to previous levels.”Even with those measures, it’s impossible for workers to stay far enough apart, said Julie Pryde, Champaign County’s health administrator. She’s increased her office’s efforts to respond.Julie Pryde, director of the Champaign County Public Health district in Illinois, is ramping up her office's efforts against the virus. Darrell Hoemann/Midwest Center for Investigative ReportingThe health department retrained all its Spanish-speaking employees to trace contacts among Rantoul’s heavily immigrant workforce. And it has hired translators for at least five languages, including Lingala, a French Congolese dialect, and Q’anjob’al, from Guatemala.Carpooling workers and crowded living conditions factored into the virus’s spread, Pryde said. But so did the company’s labor practices: Without paid sick leave, workers who brought in little money continued showing up, she said.“Someone brought it in,” she said. “With no infection control measures in place, it just took off.”A history of problemsThe warning signs were there for decades.Worker advocates and government watchdogs have long cited endemic problems that thwart workplace safety. Among them: Workers are forced to slaughter and process animals at breakneck speeds. They get infrequent bathroom breaks. They crowd tight spaces. They are discouraged from taking sick time. They lack personal protective gear.Despite these red flags, the industry has continued to operate with little safety oversight.Federal authorities say the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is in charge of monitoring worker safety at meatpacking plants, but the agency has so far had a limited role. Most OSHA inspections are complaint-based, and government watchdogs have long noted a lack of injury and illness reporting among meat and poultry workers and their employers.How pandemics like COVID-19 can affect meat shortages and price gauging Pandemics like the coronavirus can have crippling effects on our food supply. The bottleneck starts from the processing plants. Just the FAQS, USA TODAYDespite publicized coronavirus outbreaks in at least 192 plants, OSHA has inspected four for COVID-19 safety violations, an agency spokesperson said. It's received 48 complaints related to the coronavirus in meatpacking plants, the spokesperson said.In the past three years, about 40% of meatpacking violations OSHA found resulted in no financial penalties. Among those that did get fines, the average was $3,100 — a fraction of some companies’ multibillion-dollar annual revenues.Even now, with the coronavirus raging through its plants, meatpacking companies are working with the federal government to stay open despite a chorus of complaints from critics saying companies value production numbers over worker safety.At least 46 plants have closed since the start of the pandemic, according to the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting. Some shut their doors for a day of deep cleaning. Others halted operations for weeks.The closures precipitated a drop in production, sparking fears of national meat shortages and prompting the Trump administration to step in.Show caption Hide caption Medical staff prepare to test workers for COVID-19 at Rantoul Foods on May 8 as part of a two-day mass testing event. About 227 workers... Medical staff prepare to test workers for COVID-19 at Rantoul Foods on May 8 as part of a two-day mass testing event. About 227 workers were tested. Plant officials said then that 200 more workers remained to be tested; however, no further testing events have been conducted. Instead, plant workers are encouraged to get tested at local health facilities. Pam Dempsey/Midwest Center for Investigative ReportingOn April 28, President Donald Trump declared meat processing plants “critical infrastructure” and directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture to work with companies to keep them open. Those that don’t cooperate face executive action.The move met swift backlash from unions and labor advocates.“Using executive power to force people back on the job without proper protections is wrong and dangerous,” tweeted Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO.The industry experienced a steady recovery from the end of April, when the number of cattle, hogs, and sheep being slaughtered was about 40% lower than the same time a year earlier, according to daily production data by the USDA. By this week it was still about 15% lower, however.Specht predicted in April that the industry would choose production over worker safety.“I suspected workers were going to be sacrificed to keep people eating their meat,” he said, “and that’s exactly how it played out.”Essential and expendableLike thousands of meatpackers across the country, Maria in Siler Citysaid she faced a choice: Risk her life for a job that pays the bills or quit to protect her children despite the loss of income.Catherine Bassett, spokeswoman for the Mountaire Farm plant where Maria worked, said the company installed physical barriers between workers “by early April” and that masks were mandatory “before the CDC required it.”But Maria quit on April 26, the day she said she learned of Mountaire’s COVID-19 infections.Mountaire Farms poultry plant is on Old Highway 64 in Siler City, N.C. Paul Church“For two weeks, I didn’t hold my daughter,” she said of her toddler. “She would follow me and I felt very bad, but I told my two other kids to take care of her, play with her and keep her busy. I didn’t know if I had the virus.”Even though she's getting low on money, she said she won’t return to the line.“We may be essential, but we’re also expendable,” she said. “If I get infected and I don’t go to work, the factory is not going to stop. There are many people out there that need the job as much as I do that can take it.”Meatpackers haven’t always been expendable, low-wage employees, said Roger Horowitz, a professor at the University of Delaware who studies the industry’s history.In the 1950s, when most plants operated in urban areas and 9 in 10 meat packers belonged to a union, they earned wages above the national average for industrial workers. Turnover was low.In 1950, the average meatpacking worker earned about $34,400 a year in today’s dollars, and providing paid sick leave was the industry norm, according to a Department of Labor study. Today, the average worker earns $29,600, with no paid sick leave, which has cultivated a culture of working while ill.By the 1950s, the industry appeared to have moved beyond the horrors described in Upton Sinclair’s classic “The Jungle.” The 1906 novel shocked Americans with its depiction of how meatpacking plants exploited low-paid immigrants — mostly Eastern Europeans and Irish — exposing them to harsh conditions at barely livable wages.But companies like Iowa Beef Processors, which Tyson Foods now owns, soon began moving their plants to rural areas nearer to feedlots and farms and with less union control.By the 1990s only about 1 in 5 meatpackers belonged to a union, and Horowitz said wages had declined to 30% below the average for industrial workers.At the same time, meat got cheaper. Beef prices dropped about 30 cents a pound from 1970, adjusted for inflation, according to USDA data. Pork prices fell about 65 cents a pound. Since 1980, chicken prices decreased about 45 cents a pound.Companies benefited from technological advancements to build larger, more specialized plants to profit on economies of scale. To staff them, companies sought laborers who were willing to work for cheap and live in rural areas, according to a USDA study.The industry returned to its reliance on immigrant labor, which had categorized its earliest days, Horowitz said, starting with people from Latin America and more recently shifting to refugees, especially from Africa. More than a quarter of all meat and poultry workers were foreign-born non-citizens in 2015, according to a Government Accountability Office report.Cheap labor, shared housingCompanies didn’t just attract immigrants. In some cases, they actively recruited them in search of a steady supply of unskilled labor.The B.C. Rogers poultry processing plant in Mississippi used to fly one of its Spanish-speaking workers to border towns in Texas and to Miami specifically to interview Latinos at local unemployment offices.The employee, Luis Cartagena, would then fly back to Mississippi, and busloads of new hires would arrive days later. Workers were provided a few weeks of free rent, beds and a bedsheet, Cartagena told the Clarion Ledger, part of the USA TODAY Network.They called it the “Hispanic Project.”“I offered them a job,"" Cartagena told the newspaper. ""I offered them where to live. A lot of people like it. They came, but finally when they start working in the plant — it’s a hard life, working the plants — a lot of them quit.”Show caption Hide caption A car sporting a sign calling for a safe and healthy workplace drives past Smithfield Foods, Inc. in Sioux Falls on April 9, 2020 during... A car sporting a sign calling for a safe and healthy workplace drives past Smithfield Foods, Inc. in Sioux Falls on April 9, 2020 during a protest on behalf of employees after many workers complained of unsafe working conditions due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The pork processing plant in South Dakota is closing temporarily after more than 80 employees tested positive for the coronavirus. Erin Bormett, The Argus LeaderThe rural, immigrant workers who churn through the plants are especially vulnerable to a disease outbreak even before they step onto the line, experts said.For starters, health outcomes in rural areas are worse than in urban settings. Rural residents are more likely to have underlying conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes or kidney problems, which exacerbate the effects of the virus. Minorities in rural areas are more likely to die at an earlier age, according to the University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center.Those who are undocumented can’t buy health coverage or legally drive. Many live in multigenerational households, meaning the crowded conditions at work continue when they return home, according to a report this month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.U.S. Secretary for Health and Human Services Alex Azar took heat this month for blaming meatpacking workers' ""home and social"" lives for plant outbreaks. In a call with lawmakers first reported by Politico, Azar said many of the workers live in congregate housing and could have introduced the virus into the plants instead of the other way around.When William Candler, a health official with the Rock Island County Health Department in Illinois, interviewed three meatpackers with COVID-19 who worked at the same plant, he discovered all lived in the same house with four other people. Those people also are presumed to have gotten the virus, Candler said, although they were not tested.And in the Texas panhandle, meatpackers for JBS share a company bus that takes them from Amarillo, where many live, to the beef plant in Cactus, some 60 miles away.At least 323 workers have contracted COVID-19 at the Cactus plant where about 3,200 employees — mostly immigrants and refugees speaking a score or more different languages — provide beef to 10 million people a day. One has reportedly died.JBS increased its bus fleet to allow every-other-row seating and required masks and temperature checks.‘Work while sick’ cultureAmplifying the problem, experts said, is that meatpackers feel pressured to work even when sick, a problem the CDC cited in its report this month on COVID-19 outbreaks in meatpacking plants.“Some employees were incentivized to work while ill as a result of medical leave and disability policies and attendance bonuses that could encourage working while experiencing symptoms,” the report said.Before quitting, Maria said, she’d swallow “a bunch of pills and try to do the job because there was no other option.”Workers at a JBS plant in Greeley, Colorado, told doctors and nurses of a ""work while sick"" culture while seeking help for breathing problems in early April, according to emails obtained by USA TODAY. The local health officer raised those concerns in a letter to the company's human resources director, the emails showed.A JBS beef plant in Greeley, Colorado installed barriers to enforce worker spacing after a COVID-19 outbreak shuttered the plant. This photo appeared in a reopening plan the company sent to local health officials. JBSTo keep their jobs, workers know they have to keep showing up.“You can’t be the squeaky wheel in the assembly line,” said Carrie Henning-Smith of the Rural Health Research Center in Minnesota. “It doesn’t leave you with much power and control.”Sickness was rampant in the meatpacking industry even before the coronavirus. Meat and poultry workers experienced higher illness rates than other manufacturing workers — nearly 160 cases per 10,000 full-time meat and poultry workers in 2013, compared with about 40 cases for manufacturing overall, according to a 2016 U.S. Government Accountability Office report.Those rates are likely even higher, the report said, because both workers and employers may underreport injuries and illnesses. For the worker, it’s from fear of job loss, the report said. For the employer, it’s from fear of the potential costs associated with those injuries and illnesses.“Some meat and poultry workers may be less likely to report injuries and illnesses because of their vulnerable status as undocumented or foreign-born workers,” the 2016 GAO report noted.What’s more, the health units in these meatpacking plants have numerous problems, including “lack of supervision of medical personnel, personnel working outside their scope of practice, out-of-date health unit protocols, inappropriate response to injuries and illness, lack of quality assurance, poor worker access to health units, and inadequate record keeping,” a 2017 GAO report found.“They’ll just leave, and we’ll hire someone else,” Horowitz said of the companies’ thinking. “It’s a philosophy of labor turnover.”Crowded, dangerous workplaceEven before a deadly virus struck, working at a meatpacking plant could be fatal.Workers on butchering and cutting lines have died from knife accidents. In one case, a worker trying to return his knife to his belt sheath “missed the opening and pushed the knife into his leg, severed his femoral artery, and died,” according to a 2005 Government Accountability Office Report.The same report detailed meatpacking deaths from chemical exposure, machine injuries and encounters with animals that “struggle and thrash about wildly” if they’re not yet dead when hung on the line.One worker “died after being sprayed with 400 pounds of toxic liquid ammonia while attempting to fix a pipe,” the report said. In another incident, “an employee was killed when a rack of sausage fell from a manual overhead conveyor system and struck him.”Now, meatpackers face a new deadly work hazard. The coronavirus, an invisible virus transmittable on the breath of their coworkers, has infiltrated plants with little room for social distancing.The lines in meatpacking plants are crowded because carcass cutting can’t be automated with machines. It requires humans to break down an animal into meat for the dinner table, precisely cutting carcasses of various sizes into thighs, breasts, loins and steaks.The higher the plant’s output, the more workers it must add to the line.“Right now we are seeing how one of the major bottlenecks of this system is the human body,” said Blanchette, the Tufts University anthropologist. “That has long been a problem, but until we had this outbreak … it has not been discussed very much publicly.”Even the way air circulates in a meat packing plant can spread the coronavirus, said Al Heber, a Purdue University professor who has studied the ventilation systems.In a plant's ""hot"" area, animals are slaughtered, and large exhaust fans direct contaminants away from meat processing stations, Heber said. But in the ""cold"" area, where the meat needs to be preserved, airflow is limited. Workers are packed along the line in cold areas, and, if the virus got in, it would linger in the air.Help support quality local journalism like this. Subscribe Get news and insights sent to your inbox. Sign up for email newsletters. Sign upAccording to the CDC, in general, coronaviruses also linger longer in colder, dryer environments.""There's no way there's a containment,"" Heber said. The ventilation system is ""not designed to prevent person-to-person transfer of the disease.""During the pandemic, meatpacking companies are installing plastic barriers between production line workers and requiring employees to wear masks to prevent the virus from spreading.But that wasn’t enough at a Tyson plant in Rock Island County, Illinois, where health officials on April 23 found the partitions did not prevent contaminated air from “circulating within a worker’s breathing zone.”Inspectors recommended that Tyson extend the barriers, and the company says it did.Inspectors also recommended installing a system that filters air through ultraviolet light to kill the virus. That system was installed this past weekend in some high-traffic areas such as the locker room, said Ashley LaCroix, a Tyson Foods spokeswoman.Tough choices for workersEven with the plant modifications, too many meatpackers know someone who has fallen ill from coronavirus or someone who has died from it. That they, too, will be infected seems less like an “if” and more like a “when.”Plant workers who once feared they would lose their jobs if they took a day off now fear going to work at all. Many have stopped showing up.At one point, the Mountaire Farms poultry plant where Maria worked stopped operating four of its eight production lines because of low attendance, said Ilana Dubester, who runs a Hispanic advocacy organization and talks to some of the plant workers there.Ilana Dubester, Executive Director of The Hispanic Liasson, poses for a photo at her home in Pittsboro, NC. PAUL CHURCH/ THE COURIER-TRIBUNETyson plants in Arkansas increased the speeds of their production lines because fewer workers are showing up, said Magaly Licolli, the founder of Vencemeros, an organization that advocates for poultry plant employees. The speeds are so fast, she said, that the workers, already used to cutting in a hurry, are getting tired.One worker she spoke with said his supervisors told him the line had to go faster because America faced a crisis — meat shortages.As fewer workers show up, Licolli said, “workers are often going from one department to the other.”And that can spread the coronavirus.One worker at a Tyson plant in Rogers, Arkansas, said managers moved him onto a line with a man who’d tested positive.“I told the human resource assistant I wasn’t comfortable and I didn’t feel safe in that line,” said the worker, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his livelihood.He wanted to go home but was told he’d lose a point, which could lead to his firing, he said. In mid-April, he took a week off, forgoing his $450 check.Despite many missing workers, production has remained the same, he said. Managers find workers around the plant and set them to cutting, he said.The company provides masks and checks temperatures, but he still doesn’t feel safe. People congregate at entrances when they clock in and scramble to find coats that people from the previous shift wore, he said.“They don’t value us at all,” he said.Contributing: USA TODAY data reporter Matt WynnThis story is a collaboration between USA TODAY and the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting.

"When businesses shut down, truckers lost work, risked their health to keep America open",None,,2020-05-21,"Trevor Hughes/USA TODAYTweet Share James Rodgers Especially with these asymptomatic carriers, I’m afraid to go home. I don’t want to take it home to my wife, to my daughter. Quote iconAcross the country, many of the warehouses that truckers serve have instituted temperature screenings, barring drivers with fevers or other coronavirus symptoms. Rodgers says he wishes he had more convenient access to testing, so he could know whether he and his other drivers have already been exposed.But even as truckers risk their lives to deliver goods to America, their livelihood is threatened by the pandemic. The trucking industry hauls a staggering two-thirds of all freight in the country, moving 10 billion tons of food, toiletries, online purchases and construction materials. As the economy slows down, there are fewer goods to be delivered. In some cases, Rodgers is seeing rates drop below a $1 a mile, when he needs to be making about twice that to stay afloat.Analysts at fleet management platform Keep Truckin say there's already been a 25% drop in the number of trucks on the road each day since March, and a 20% drop in the number of miles driven, and federal statistics show at least 88,000 truckers lost their jobs in April as businesses shuttered. Truckers gathered outside the White House Friday to protest wage losses.Trucker James Rodgers drives his big rig across Wyoming to deliver a load of cleaning supplies to a warehouse in Salt Lake City.

Trucker James Rodgers drives his big rig across Wyoming to deliver a load of cleaning supplies to a warehouse in Salt Lake City. Trevor Hughes/USA TODAYRodger's tried to get the attention of Congress by making YouTube videos and emailing legislators in hopes they'll pass a relief package to subsidize freight fees during the pandemic. As he drives, he makes and takes calls on a headset, plotting truck locations and dropoff times, negotiating deliveries and staffing, his mind thousands of miles and days down the road.He counts himself lucky that he's in a better financial position than most truckers: After he broke his back and was discharged from the Army, he was given his Freightliner by the St. Christopher Truckers Relief Fund, allowing him to start his own business. Named for the patron saint of travelers, the fund helps truckers when they can't work because of illness or injury.Because most truckers are independent contractors, they didn't qualify for some portions of the existing federal coronavirus assistance. Truckers like Rodgers say what they could qualify for was immediately snapped up by bigger trucking companies, even as President Donald Trump has praised truckers as ""foot soldiers"" carrying the nation to ""victory"" against the virus.These days, a fabric mask hangs from Rodgers' rearview mirror, and rubber gloves and sanitizing spray sit beneath his seat. While he drives hundreds of miles a day across multiple states, his interactions with strangers are few and far between. The one exception: his American Staffordshire Terrier named Sergeant, who rides in the passenger seat, his wet nose smearing the windows.Trucker James Rodgers drives his big rig across Wyoming to deliver a load of cleaning supplies to a warehouse in Salt Lake City. Trevor Hughes, Trevor Hughes-USA TODAY NETWORK‘They take us for granted and we’re doing it for them’After a quick rest stop at a gas station on Wyoming's windswept plains, a grinning Rodgers climbs back into the cab, a bag of Hot Pockets clutched in his hand. Although he suffered serious injuries in the Army, you have to look hard to see the stiffness in his back and legs.Rodgers joined the U.S. Army with the intent to serve his country for at least 20 years.""I was good at it, really good at it,"" he says.Deployed to Afghanistan, he and his soldiers were patrolling when they came under fire and a mortar round blew him off the top of the armored vehicle. The explosion broke his back and he medically retired from the Army in 2013 with a full disability pension. While his back mostly healed, he became addicted to opiates and narcotics, carrying around a plastic bag full of pills.""Whenever I needed more, I'd just go to the emergency room and say 'veteran, broken back, hurts' and they'd give me more,"" he said.Rodgers says he was missing the sense of purpose that comes from serving something bigger than himself. As he recovered from addiction, he found his purpose anew in driving a truck.Rodgers remembers waving to passing truckers and motioning for them to blow their horns as a boy riding in his parents' vehicle. The memory brings a smile to his face, and he's happy now to blow his specially installed locomotive horn for any passing cars.Today, he takes a deep pride in fulfilling his missions – accepting orders from fright brokers, and overcoming logistical hurdles and weather-related obstacles to deliver safely and on time."
Trump attacks Michigan AG after she calls him a 'petulant child' over mask dispute,POLITICS,Nicholas Wu,2020-05-22,"President Donald Trump lashed out at Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel in a series of late-night Twitter posts Thursday after she called him a ""petulant child"" for not wearing a mask during most of his tour tour of a Ford plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan and suggested the company could face consequences for allowing him to violate state orders.Deriding her as the ""Do nothing A.G. of the Great State of Michigan,"" Trump wrote that Nessel should not take her ""anger and stupidity out on Ford Motor"" or else the company might leave the state.Trump said it was not Ford's fault he did not wear a mask during the part of the tour that was open to news media cameras, but he added: ""I did put on a mask"" for part of the visit.Nessel, a Democrat, had slammed Trump for not wearing a mask, telling CNN on Thursday, ""This is not a joke. He’s conveying the worst possible message to people who cannot afford to be on the receiving end of terrible misinformation.""The state would need to have a ""very serious conversation with Ford"" if they allowed him to violate the state's orders on mask-wearing, Nessel added.Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer's executive orders mandate face masks in public enclosed spaces, and Ford policy required masks as well. Nessel sent a letter to Trump earlier Wednesday asking him to wear a mask out of a legal, social, and moral responsibility ""to take reasonable precautions to prevent further spread of the virus.""Whitmer also criticized Trump for not wearing a mask during the public part of the tour, telling MSNBC's Rachel Maddow. ""It wasn't surprising, but it was disappointing,"" the governor said of Trump's decision.""Anyone in a position of power and responsibility, I hope, emulates and does precisely what they're asking everyone else to do,"" she said.Ford executives had encouraged Trump to wear a mask during his tour of the factory Thursday, but he told reporters he took it off when he came near new media photographers because he ""didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.""In a statement issued shortly after he left the Ford facility, the company said William Clay Ford Jr., the company's executive chairman and the great-grandson of Henry Ford had ""encouraged"" Trump to wear a mask.""Bill Ford encouraged President Trump to wear a mask when he arrived,"" the company said in the statement.

"So long, standardized testing: University of California regents unanimously vote to drop SAT and ACT admissions requirements",NATION,Jessica Flores,2020-05-21,"One of the largest and most prestigious university systems in the country made a landmark decision on Thursday, reshaping its admissions process by ditching standardized testing.The University of California Board of Regents unanimously voted to suspend the SAT and ACT testing requirements for freshman applicants through 2024 and eliminate them for California students after that – a plan proposed by Janet Napolitano, the university's system's president.“Today’s decision by the Board marks a significant change for the University’s undergraduate admissions,” Napolitano said.Instead, the UC system – which includes about 280,000 students across the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of California, Berkeley, and seven other undergraduate schools – will focus on creating its own test ""that better aligns with the content the University expects students to have mastered for college readiness"" and its values, according to a news release.“I think this is an incredible step in the right direction toward aligning our admissions policy with the broad-based values of the University,” UC Board of Regents Chair John A. Pérez said in the release. “I see our role as fiduciaries and stewards of the public good and this proposal before us is an incredible step in the right direction.”The 'really smart guy' who aced SATs for rich students: 'I will always regret' the scandalThe approved plan will make SAT and ACT test scores optional for 2021-22 and 2022-23 applicants. By 2025, both testing requirements will be eliminated for California students, even if the new test created by the system is considered ""unfeasible or not ready,"" says the release.For the 2023-24 and 2024-25, there will be a ""test-blind"" process, meaning universities won't use testing scores for admissions but they can use them for other purposes like scholarships and course placements.The UC system's vote could be a turning point in the long-running debate about the equality of standardized testing, which critics have argued are biased against low-income and minority students and favor wealthier students whose families can afford to spend thousands of dollars on preparatory courses.Last year, a coalition of civil rights groups filed a lawsuit against the UC system because of its use of testing scores for admission. The group said that its SAT and ACT requirement discriminates against students who can't afford testing preparation.“These tests are incredibly sensitive to socioeconomic status and race and have nothing to say about the individual,” said Alisa Hartz, an attorney with Public Counsel, the Los Angeles-based pro bono firm that filed the suit on behalf of students and advocacy groups.In March, the UC system had temporarily suspended SAT scores for fall 2021, making the tests optional for students.Contributing: Marco della Cava, USA TODAY; The Associated Press"
"Opinion: MLB traditionalists won't like it, but the designated hitter will come to the NL. They better get used to it.",None,Bob Nightengale,2020-05-22,"PHOENIX -- You may love it, you may hate it, but no doubt about it, it’s coming soon to a city near you once Major League Baseball is back.Fans in St. Louis, Cincinnati, Philadelphia and all the other National League cities will have no choice but to adapt. They will have to adjust their scorecards. Re-think their baseball strategy. Learn to second-guess their managers differently. And, yes, even have an open mind.The designated hitter rule is coming to the National League for the first time this year.It will vanish again in 2021 in the NL, with the division and league schedules reverting back to their traditional ways, but beginning in 2022, under a new collective bargaining agreement, the universal DH will be here to stay.The players, knowing it will prolong careers and inflate checking accounts, are advocating for it. Most general managers, fearful of their prized pitchers getting hurt at the plate or on the basepaths, are in favor. Many fans, wanting as much offense as possible, are craving it.It’s the traditionalists who are balking at the idea.Only this time, just like when we went from day games to night games, leagues were broken up into divisions, walk-up songs were introduced and Gatorade baths replaced hand-shaking celebrations, the DH is coming, and after the 2021 season, will be here to stay. Why fight it any longer?2020 SEASON: MLB and players must agree to save seasonNO SUNFLOWER SEEDS? Will MLB's safety and health protocol keep players safe?FIND OUT: Will your MLB team play at home?NL DH? A universal DH opens the door to these potential breakout NL hittersBesides, traditional National League strategy as we’ve long known it has disappeared. No one knows how to bunt. Hit-and-runs are executed as frequently as complete games. And pitchers treat plate appearances as fondly as prostate exams.Pitchers went to the plate nearly 5,000 times last year and hit just .127. They had a .137 on-base percentage. Their OPS (on-base-plus-slugging-percentage) was .317. Oh, and you got to see them strike out 2,230 times.The traditionalists will argue that the DH sullies baseball strategy, with managers trying to decide whether to keep their pitchers in a close game or summon a pinch-hitter for a key moment.St. Louis Cardinals fans will forever remember Game 6 of the 2011 World Series against the Texas Rangers for David Freese’s heroics, but in that game, Rangers starter Colby Lewis twice came to the plate with a chance to break it open. He bunted into a double-play one at-bat with runners on first and second and struck out with the bases loaded in another.If a DH had been used in those games in St. Louis, the Rangers would have been the World Series champions.Sure, managing in the NL can be challenging, but the beauty of managing in the American League, Hall of Fame manager Tony La Russa said, is the uncertainty of when to take out your pitcher. In the NL, that decision can almost automatically be made for you, said La Russa, who won three pennants and two World Series championships in 16 years with the Cardinals.La Russa, who also won two pennants and a World Series championship in 18 years in the AL with the Oakland A’s and Chicago White Sox, said the decision is never made for you there.“The one part about managing in the AL that is more difficult than the NL is handling pitching during a game,’’ La Russa told USA TODAY Sports. ""The decision every manager has to face in a tight situation is who’s the right pitcher to pitch to that next hitter. And a lot of times in the AL, that becomes a very hairy call. It’s a really tough decision.“In the NL, often enough about the time you need to make that decision, your pitcher is coming to bat, anyways. So you make the move because you need to get a pinch-hitter in there to get the offense going. In the AL, you can wear out a starting pitcher, or even a reliever, because you don’t ever have to take him out. In the NL, the guy goes out right away if you use that spot to pinch-hit.’’Still, La Russa -- now special advisor for the Los Angeles Angels -- won’t argue that managing in the NL can be more demanding with the pitcher hitting, knowing you need to rely much more heavily on manufacturing runs rather than sitting back and waiting for a three-run homer.“Managing in the NL, you have more situations that you have to deal with the pitcher in the lineup, and that makes it more fun. Quite often late in games, you’ll have a situation where you really have to concentrate on making a run or stopping a run. So for people that love the game, the little ball can be entertaining.""There’s a beauty to playing all parts of the game. But for people that just want the offense, who like seeing guys swing from their ass for those crooked numbers, they don’t appreciate it.’’The looming question, of course, is whether fans in NL cities will hate the DH even more, perhaps grow to tolerate it or perhaps even like it?“I think the game is more than just whether we have a DH or don’t have a DH,"" La Russa said. “It’s how the game of baseball is being played. In St. Louis, they loved seeing those Whitey Herzog teams steal bases. So if a team with a DH is still stealing bases, I think they’ll like that.’’The ultimate decision will come next year during the collective bargaining agreement negotiations for the 2022 season and beyond. There needs to be 75% approval of all owners to make the call, with half of the owners, of course, residing in the National League.When the baseball season comes back -- and yes, despite all of the posturing and rhetoric, it will be back -- it will expose the appetite for a universal DH. Yet love it or hate it, adapt to it or rebel against it, the DH is coming.Really, even those of us who love baseball’s wonderful traditions will be just fine.Follow Bob Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale."
Fake crowd noise for NFL broadcasts? NBC's Al Michaels bracing for 'a year of trial and error',None,Jarrett Bell,2020-05-22,"Al Michaels is hardly a fan of using artificial sound for ""Sunday Night Football"" broadcasts that may be destined to originate from empty stadiums. Yet Michaels, arguably the most revered play-by-play voice on the sports landscape, can envision the perfect situation to make an exception.“I think the one time we probably could use a laugh track is if we see another butt-fumble like the Mark Sanchez play,” Michaels told USA TODAY Sports, reminiscing about the infamous play he called on Thanksgiving in 2012 that involved the then-Jets quarterback. “We’ll throw in a laugh track for you.”At this point, not even Michaels’ tongue-in-cheek suggestion can be completely ruled out as NBC’s signature show – No. 1 in prime time for a TV-record nine consecutive seasons – sorts through the options of how to best present the weekly showcase game against a different type of backdrop for at least part of the would-be NFL season.Like all of the networks preparing for broadcasts of NFL games and other sports as the nation begins to reopen amid a still-threatening coronavirus pandemic, the ""SNF"" brain trust is considering possibilities that include piped-in crowd noise, faux fans and maybe more eavesdropping and natural sound from field level than has ever been available to viewers.NFL NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox“We know it can’t be exactly the way it was,” Michaels said. “I see this as a year of trial and error.“As we go along, we’re going to learn on the fly. And I think the audience is going to understand there are going to be mistakes and it won’t look as sharp and clean as a regular game will, but I think the audience understands now it’s a different template. So, we’ll see where we go with this.”One thing seems certain: Michaels, analyst Cris Collinsworth and the production crew won’t be working the games from a far-away studio. They will be on site as usual, social distancing etiquette in tow, unless pandemic conditions dictate otherwise.“That would be the last resort, to have Al and Cris in the studio,” Fred Gaudelli, the executive producer for ""SNF,"" told USA TODAY Sports. “I don’t think anybody wants that. You would lose an awful lot if that were to happen. Obviously, you’d be in a pretty tough situation in the country if that’s the way everything was going to proceed for something like the NFL.”Although Joe Buck, the lead play-by-play voice for Fox Sports, has maintained it’s “pretty much a given” that his network will use fake crowd noise to supplement its game broadcasts, Gaudelli won’t declare that as inevitable for ""SNF.""“As a live producer, artificial anything doesn’t really sound or feel right to me,” Gaudelli said. “But at this point, we have the luxury of keeping everything on the table.”Gaudelli’s track record for innovation (bolstered by 23 Emmy Awards) bodes well for ""SNF"" amid its challenges. In 2017, he teamed with director Drew Esocoff to present the first NFL game using a SkyCam for its primary coverage, which was inspired by the emergency use of dual SkyCam coverage due to fog at Gillette Stadium for a Super Bowl LI rematch earlier that season. He also introduced the yellow first-down marker superimposed on the screen, the GoalPost Cam and real-time polling data for instant replay challenges. During his ESPN days, he was the first to track the speed of pitches during the 1988 College World Series.Now what?“I’d be shocked if something really good doesn’t come out of this for broadcasting in general,” Gaudelli said. “Just like the NFL draft, something great came out of it. I think you’re going to see that because everybody now has an opportunity to change the template a little bit – it’s forced, obviously, but now we have that opportunity, with technology and the advances made every day and a lot of creative people now are putting thought into this.”Gaudelli was impressed by the multi-network simulcast of the NFL’s stay-at-home draft, agreeing with the widespread sentiment that decision-makers were humanized by the cameras stationed in their homes.“We saw coaches and general managers as everyday people with their kids running around while they were trying to do their work,” said Gaudelli, who beginning in 1990 produced 12 consecutive drafts for ESPN. “There was a relation there between the fans and those people that never existed before because we’re all doing the same thing right now, trying to get our work done while kids are running around making noise, distracting you and all those things.”Perhaps ""SNF,"" which averaged 20.5 million viewers in 2019, can provide some at-home perspective, too, to supplement the game. Imagine Russell Wilson’s wife, Ciara, high-fiving the kids in the den after the Seahawks quarterback makes some amazing touchdown throw. Or Tom Brady’s dad, Tom, Sr., sipping on a cool beverage in his recliner while wearing a Bucs cap.Gaudelli mentioned the possibility of working with a tech company to develop an app that would allow fans to cheer from their phones. That prospect seems similar to the show of fans on the screen mounted behind Commissioner Roger Goodell in his basement as he hosted the draft, a feature that incorporated virtual reality effects provided by the Los Angeles-based operation, The Famous Group.As Gaudelli pondered, “Make an artificial application more authentic. You kind of look at all of it. We’re evaluating all of it.”It seems like a good bet that the wide-angle stadium shots that are a staple from packed houses will go by the wayside with no fans in the building. Fan reaction shots after a sack? Hardly. And we’ll see whether cheerleaders are still an essential part of the game-day experience if the stadium is empty.Gaudelli, who began preparing for the altered broadcasts six weeks ago, expects the production crew, typically consisting of roughly 175 people, will be somewhat scaled back because of pandemic restrictions. It’s a given, though, that ""SNF"" will have the 25 cameras — about twice as many compared a regional telecast — it uses for games. With no fans in the stands, the networks will suddenly have the flexibility to shoot from different angles.“I don’t know that it’s going to look much different,” Gaudelli said. “Now you can put cameras in a more ideal spot because you’re not going to be blocking anyone. It might be a little more intimately done, but I don’t think it’s going to be anything where anybody at home is going to say, ‘Wow, this is completely different!’""Besides, it won’t be the first time Michaels calls games from nearly empty stadiums. During the mid-1970s, he called San Francisco Giants baseball games.“Terrible teams playing in a terrible ballpark, Candlestick Park,” Michaels said. “We were always 25 games out of first by August. We played San Diego on a Thursday night in August of ’75 or so. Somebody would always come in (the booth) in the seventh inning and hand a slip of paper with the attendance.“I said on the air, ‘Tonight’s attendance … well, why don’t I just tell you whose here: Arnie Saluski has come down from Mill Valley. The Delpart family has driven down from Saratoga…’ So, we can have a little fun with that, maybe, during the course of the season. But, trust me, I know how to do games without fans.”Nothing will change, Michaels insists, with the philosophy that a broadcaster’s job is basically to get out of the game the story of the game.“We never go into this – Cris, Michele (Tafoya, sideline reporter) and I – saying, ‘Hey, we’re the show,’ “ Michaels said. “We’re an adjunct. We’re there to inform, to entertain, to elucidate, to analyze. The game is the show. Maybe when we come on the air, we’ll obviously make reference to the fact that it’s different, maybe pull the curtain back a little and show how it’s different. But once the game starts, that’s why people tune in.”Michaels realizes that in the big picture, the adjustment for the TV networks and the viewers will pale when compared to the NFL teams and players likely trying to roll in a pandemic.“Let’s just hope that No. 1, they can play football,” Michaels said, “and No. 2, this doesn’t last a long time.”If you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

Jurassic bug: Researchers find 151-million-year-old Morrisonnepa Jurassica insect fossil in Utah,NATION,Jordan Culver,2020-05-21,"How many more insects will rise to fame in 2020?Fortunately, unlike ""murder hornets"" and gypsy moths, the insect recently found in Utah isn't a threat to anyone anymore. Paleontologists in the state discovered a 151-million-year-old fossil of a giant bug called Morrisonnepa Jurassica, the Utah Department of Natural Resources wrote in a blog post.Researchers found the fossil in the geologically rich Morrison Formation in southeastern Utah, the DNR's blog post said.""The insect fossil consists of most of the abdomen, two elements of the forewing, and possibly the head and is only the second insect body fossil ever discovered from the Morrison Formation,' the DNR wrote.Asian giant hornets spotted in the US:What are 'Murder Hornets' and should I be worried?According to the Utah DNR, the insect was first discovered in 2017 and appears to be related to ""giant water bugs,"" which are known for their extremely painful bites.""The new fossil insect appears to be a relatively large predator whose modern relatives are known to attack and eat not just other invertebrates like snails and crustaceans but also vertebrate prey such as fish, amphibians, and snakes,"" the department wrote in its post.The fossil was found in the same Rocky Mountain region that has produced dinosaurs like apatosaurus, allosaurus and stegosaurus, according to the Utah DNR. The area has also ""yielded an abundance of plant fossils.""“We always dreamed of finding actual insect fossils in the Morrison, but until the first report in 2011 there had been nothing,” Utah Field House of Natural History State Park Museum paleontologist John Foster told the department.“That report gave us hope, but still, when this specimen appeared under a microscope, mixed in with a bulk batch of unidentified plant fossil material, it was shocking to realize that we were looking at an insect abdomen and wing – and big ones.”The fossil is in the paleontology collections at the Utah Field House of Natural History State Park Museum."
Veepstakes: More contenders emerge on short list for Biden's running mate and undergo vetting,ELECTIONS,Savannah Behrmann,2020-05-21,"WASHINGTON – More potential vice president contenders emerged Thursday as being on the short list or having advanced to the vetting stage to become Joe Biden's running mate, multiple news outlets report.CBS News first reported that Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., has been asked by Biden's campaign to undergo a formal vetting to be considered for the veep slot.More:Joe Biden vowed to pick a woman VP. Some Democrats say she must be a woman of color2020:Meet the team who will help Joe Biden pick his vice presidential running mateIt’s not yet clear if Klobuchar, who ran for the 2020 Democratic nomination herself, has consented to the vetting, however, CBS reported that the request for such information from potential running mates like Klobuchar ""is underway.""The vetting process will be handled by Biden's vice presidential selection committee, which includes four co-chairs: former U.S. Sen. Christopher Dodd; U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester; Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti; and Cynthia Hogan, former White House and Senate counsel to Biden.Opinion: Stacey Abrams shouldn't be Biden's VP, but she's changed the game for womenRep. Val Demings, D-Fla., also said she was on Biden's short list, while NBC News reported that she has begun the vetting process.“I am on the short list and I’m honored to be on the short list,” Demings said during an interview on SiriusXM’s ""The Dean Obeidallah Show."" “I have dedicated my life to public service. I chose tough jobs. I worked right out of college as a social worker, for 27 years at the police department and had the honor of serving as the Chief of Police. Now I am in Congress. I am trying hard every day to do that job right so we can take care of the people who are struggling in this community the most.“If Vice President Biden asked me to serve along with him, I would be honored to do just that.”Demings, who was one of seven impeachment managers to oversee President Donald Trump’s trial in the Senate, was first elected to the House in 2016.She represents a district in the Orlando area, which is an important territory in the crucial battleground state of Florida.More:Judge tosses Michigan lawmakers’ suit over Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's emergency powersBesides Klobuchar and Demings, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Tuesday that she has had ""a conversation with some folks"" connected to Biden's campaign about being his running mate, but she stopped short of saying she is being seriously vetted for the job.But Whitmer's comments to NBC's ""Today"" news host Craig Melvin were among the first in which she has suggested vetting had started and that the campaign has talked to her about it.Asked if she could provide more details about the discussions, Whitmer described it as ""an opening conversation and ... not something I could call a professional, formalized vetting.""More:How Joe Biden is working to win over progressive votersFactoring into the decision could be one of the biggest battlegrounds of the election: suburban swing districts, particularly in Midwestern states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that Trump carried in 2016. That dynamic has elevated Klobuchar and Whitmer as contenders.Some other speculations include Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader and onetime gubernatorial candidate, as well as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is popular among liberals.The presumptive Democratic nominee vowed in March to pick a woman as his vice presidential running mate.Contributing: Joey Garrison, Rebecca Morrin"

‘Thought I was gonna die!’: ‘Labor of Love’ host Kristin Davis reacts to televised sperm tests,TV,Erin Jensen,2020-05-22,"As wholesome as peach pie?Former ""Sex and the City"" star Kristin Davis went from welcoming “Labor of Love” star Kristy Katzmann to Atlanta, where they filmed the debut season in early 2019, with a peach pie (that she tells USA TODAY she didn't bake because of time constraints, though she is fully “capable""), to calling for waiters in black bow ties carrying trays with specimen cups.""Y'all are ruthless,"" one of the 15 contestants hoping to start a family with Katzmann is heard saying off-screen.Davis then leads the cast to a trailer where the men will make their deposits so their sperm can be tested, all while the cameras roll.

"Wear a mask in public? Sure. Majority of Democrats, Republicans say they have, survey shows",POLITICS,Rebecca Morin,2020-05-21,"WASHINGTON – Despite high-profile incidents of Americans refusing to wear face masks, an overwhelming majority of Americans say they have worn a face covering due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey.More than four out of five Americans — 84% — said they have worn a mask in public in an effort to limit the spread of coronavirus, according to a survey from the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project.And while reopening economies and wearing a mask have at times become partisan talking points, the vast majority of Democrats and Republicans said they have worn a mask in public.The Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project is a large-scale study of the American electorate. Throughout the 2020 election cycle, the researchers aim to conduct 500,000 interviews about policies and the presidential candidates. This survey was conducted between May 7 to 14, with 4,576 Americans surveyed. There is a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.Eighty-nine percent of Democrats and 81% of Republicans say they have worn a mask in public, according to the survey. There is a small disparity among age groups, with younger people having been slightly less likely to have worn a mask in public. Roughly three out of four (78%) Americans ages 18 to 29 say they've worn a face mask in public, while 90% of Americans 65 and above say they have.Coronavirus live updates:U.S. bets $1.2 billion on new vaccineRobert Griffin, research director for the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, said that although there's a narrative that there's ""some sort of cultural war"" about wearing masks, the data does not show that.""The idea that there is a sizable portion of the population who's somehow violently opposed to this behavior that public health officials are advising just doesn't seem to line up,"" he said.Over the past several weeks, there have been several reports and viral videos of people refusing to wear face masks in public areas, such as stores and restaurants.Earlier this month, security guard Calvin Munerlyn was fatally shot after turning away a customer for trying to enter a Family Dollar in Michigan without a mask. A woman in Alabama was taken down by a police officer after an altercation with a Walmart employee who asked her to wear a mask in the store. Most recently, a video of a verbal altercation between a Costco customer and employee in Colorado went viral after the customer was asked to leave the store because he was not wearing a mask.More:The CDC says coronavirus 'does not spread easily' on surfaces or objects. Here's what we know.President Donald Trump has also declined to wear a mask in public. The Centers for Disease Control recommends ""wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.""Although there are some differences along demographic lines, the majorities of all groups have worn a mask in public, according to an analysis from Nationscape Insights, a project of Democracy Fund, UCLA, and USA TODAY.More:New nationwide study shows where Americans agree – and where Democrats differ headed into NovemberBut there is a gap among people who have worn masks when it comes to what activities they are willing to participate in if restrictions were lifted.The biggest gap was between people who would and would not attend a professional sporting event. Among people who said they would attend a sporting event if restrictions were lifted, 75% said they had worn a mask in public.But among those who said they would not attend a professional sporting event, 92% said they have worn a mask in public.The next largest gap came between those who would go to a stadium concert and those who wouldn't.Of those who said they would go to a stadium concert, 76% said they've worn a face mask in public. But among those who say they would not go to a stadium concert, 91% said they've worn a face mask in public.Griffin said there is a clear relationship where the people most likely to wear a mask ""are also the folks who are going, 'hey, I'm going to be more cautious about this even if things do reopen, and I'm not certain I'll actually engage in them at all.'

I'm a survivor of domestic abuse. Quarantine with my father would have been hell.,OPINION,Wendy Knight,2020-05-22,"Wendy KnightOpinion contributorAs coronavirus lockdowns begin to lift, millions of children trapped in abusive homes will emerge among its most silent and shattered victims. Stay-at-home orders issued by governors mask the brutal reality: Home is not safe for boys and girls who live with violent men. It’s hell.Long before the pandemic, I was one of those girls.When school let out for summer break, I was despondent. Isolated from my friends, teachers and coaches, I was deprived of the healthy interactions that sustained me. My father wouldn’t allow my mother to get a driver’s license. We couldn’t afford summer camp, bikes or other means of mobility. We were stuck at home with a man who slapped, shoved, cursed, threaten and belittled his wife, my mom. What I didn’t see, I heard from my bed or the closet where I hid. Our only reprieve came when my father was at work or out drinking.For many, quarantine is no vacationI cannot imagine living through weeks of 24-hour confinement with my violent father. Yet that is the sorrow many children have endured these past months.In a message about the “horrifying global surge in domestic violence” during the shutdowns, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres urged governments to put women’s safety first as they addressed the crisis.The response by the U.S. government was weak. Congress passed a $2 trillion coronavirus relief package in March, but a paltry .002% of that was directed to domestic violence assistance: $45 million for emergency housing and shelter for survivors and $2 million for the National Domestic Violence Hotline.We have another chance in the HEROES Act passed by the U.S. House of Representatives last week that includes $100 million proposed for the Violence Against Women Prevention and Prosecution Programs.Coronavirus is a terrifying illness:It could leave millions of survivors with PTSDHistorically, domestic violence increases during times of economic stress and uncertainty. Researchers have observed that during the Great Depression and the farm crisis of the 1980s, there was an increase in marital conflict among American families. For those facing financial hardship, the Great Recession was marked by an increase in men's abusive behavior toward their intimate partners. Job loss can put abusive men at the point of “fatal peril” — a moment when their sense of self is threatened and they snap, writes Rachel Louise Snyder in her book ""No Visible Bruises: What We Don't Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us.""Childhood trauma affects one's adult lifeRecent research has confirmed what survivors like me have learned: There is no escape from the early trauma. According to a 2018 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, adults exposed to violence as children suffer long-term psychological, financial and social consequences. They leave home with baggage the size of a shipping container stacked with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, risky behaviors and difficulty forming healthy attachments.Living in a constant state of fear impairs the development of a healthy immune system, setting the stage for chronic diseases later in life. The emotional and cognitive maturity that comes with age doesn’t ameliorate the devastation. You cannot un-see what you’ve already seen. The most debilitating effect is the sense of worthlessness.Two decades after I left home at 17, I was on book tour, a celebratory occasion. Instead of feeling joyful, I was suicidal. What was wrong with me?Confused, I ducked outside the bookstore to phone a close confidant — a successful business owner, contently married, who had also grown up in a violent home. Had he ever thought about killing himself?All the time, he replied matter of factly.I realized at that moment how damaged we were — not just me or him but all of us kids, now adults, forced to bear witness to such ugliness.Coronavirus inflicts trauma on our kids:Here's how schools can helpEventually, COVID-19 will end as did the 1918 flu, cholera and the Black Death. Scientists will develop a vaccine. Physicians will discover an effective treatment. We’ll adapt to a new normalcy of socializing and doing business.For the children confined to abusive homes, redemption will take an arduous path. But their heartbreaking journey can be buoyed by the simplest act of a neighbor or relative — a smile, an invitation to talk about their experience, a nudge of encouragement. My newly married fifth-grade teacher once told me that if she had a daughter, she wanted the girl to be like me. I clung to that thought through many dark days. The pain will linger decades after the fevers break and the bruises fade. So will a small gesture of hope.Wendy Knight is a writer and the editor of two travel books.
